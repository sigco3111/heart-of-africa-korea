# The Heart of Africa — Modern Remake

A single-player 3D remake of the 1985 exploration classic *The Heart of
Africa* — Ozark Softscape's follow-up to *The Seven Cities of Gold* (1984) —
built as a web application. You start in Cairo in 1890 with $250 and a journal,
and travel across a geographically authentic Africa in search of a lost tomb:
trading in port cities and decoding direction hints given in the regions' own language system.

If you remember *The Seven Cities of Gold*, you know the DNA: the same design
team, and the same loop of walking into an unmapped continent, watching the map
fill itself in behind you, and getting along — or not — with the peoples who
already live there. Where that game had the Americas, this one has Africa.

## Gameplay

- **Two perspectives.** A 3D bird's-eye view for the journey across the
  continent, and a first-person view inside walkable settlements; the game
  switches between them when entering or leaving a settlement.
- **Living world.** Ten port cities, 22 peoples, 17 rivers and real landmarks
  at their correct 1890 positions; the map is trimmed to the walkable continent
  (the world ends at the African Red Sea coast). Settlements are densely built
  and inhabited: procedurally varied dwellings, street networks, and villagers
  who go about their routines, with full player/NPC collision. Ambient wildlife
  streams with the journey — grazing herds that raise calves, predator hunts
  with regional food webs, elephant herds, vultures and shore life.
- **Trade and cultural contact.** Buy equipment, provisions and gifts in port
  cities; a culturally correct gift to a village chief unlocks a hint. Bazaars
  pay regional prices for treasure finds (continent-wide arbitrage), travel
  agencies sell ferry passages, and discovery bounties arrive at the next port
  as telegraphic transfers.
- **Language and direction system.** Hints are given in the regional
  Nivera/koko/Katula system and must be decoded into bearings and positions.
- **Survival.** Provisions, a canteen with a draining water level, and a health
  pool worn down by starvation, fever, dehydration, sun blindness and wounds;
  medicine cures, fresh water and rest restore.
- **An authentic 1890 climate and its people.** Every place runs its own
  researched seasonal calendar — the Sahel's humid-period rains, the
  harmattan's dust pall, the October Nile flood and the Okavango's inverted
  July flood, snow only on the peaks that really carried it — and the
  inhabitants answer it as the period sources describe: six peoples
  put on a documented seasonal garment (rank-gated where the record says so),
  while for the rest the season shows in the fire, the market and who is
  away with the herds.
- **Journal.** A chronicle that grows automatically with events and stores
  decoded hints, language-neutrally, re-rendered in the selected language.
  Every English entry can be read aloud in-browser
  via the Kokoro TTS model, with emotional voice markup shaping the delivery.
- **Saving and controls.** Automatic checkpoints on every port visit with a
  tabular load overview.
- **The goal.** A procedurally placed tomb triangulated from regional hints;
  digging at the right spot with the shovel wins the game.

### Audio

Deliberately still open. The 1985 original's score is not used here in any
form, and no placeholder music has been dropped in either — the sound design
deserves to be decided rather than defaulted into. Ideas and collaborators
welcome; see [Contact](#contact).

## Tech stack

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + React 19 + TypeScript
- [three.js](https://threejs.org/) via [@react-three/fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) and [drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei)
- **WebGPU renderer with automatic WebGL 2 fallback** — shaders are written in
  TSL (Three Shading Language) so one code path serves both backends
- [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for game state
- [kokoro-js](https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro) for the in-browser journal
  read-aloud (lazy-loaded, synthesized in a Web Worker)
- [oxlint](https://oxc.rs/) for linting

Rendering features include real-DEM terrain with biome-based PBR texture
splatting, hand-authored ~1890 hydrology vectors, a physically grounded
scattering sky with IBL, cascaded shadows, SSAO, TRAA, bloom, filmic tone
mapping, and water with a wave field, depth-dependent absorption and shore
foam.

## Getting started

Requires Node.js ≥ 20.

```
npm install
npm run dev        # dev server at http://localhost:5173
```

Other scripts:

```
npm run build      # type-check + production build (must pass clean)
npm run preview    # serve the production build locally
npm run lint       # oxlint (zero errors/warnings required)
npm audit          # zero known vulnerabilities required
npm run test:unit  # fast Vitest layer (jsdom): logic, store, HUD components
npm run test:small # everyday gate: Vitest + the core browser suites (no preview)
npm test           # full (LARGE) headless regression: every suite + preview
```

The game starts in English by default; German can be selected at runtime via
the debug menu (F1). All player-facing text lives in `src/i18n/` — adding a
language means adding one file.

## Geodata

The terrain uses real elevation data. The runtime assets in `public/geodata/`
are generated reproducibly (no npm dependencies) by the scripts in
[`scripts/`](scripts/README.md):

```
node scripts/build-geodata.mjs              # DEM from public Terrarium tiles
node scripts/generate-terrain-textures.mjs  # tileable terrain textures (bird's-eye)
node scripts/generate-surface-textures.mjs  # tileable settlement surfaces (first-person)
```

At load time the DEM is trimmed to the game world: only land connected to the
game's own land masses is kept, so Sinai, Arabia, southern Europe, foreign
islands and the unreachable Madagascar render as open sea
(`src/world/redSea.ts`); `dem.png` itself stays untouched.

└── world/           geography, geodata sampling, hydrology, terrain model
```

`design.md` is the authoritative design document; `CLAUDE.md` defines the POC
scope, acceptance criteria and build rules.

## Status

This repository contains the **proof of concept**: the core gameplay loop is not fully developed.

All 32 acceptance criteria of `CLAUDE.md` §7.1 are implemented, with the
screenshot evidence in `verification/`; the simplifications and open items that
remain are recorded in the code (`// OPEN:`) and in `TASKS.md`.

The full headless regression runs with `npm test` — a fast Vitest (jsdom) layer
plus 15 Playwright browser suites; the test strategy and coverage map live in
[`scripts/verify/README.md`](scripts/verify/README.md).

## Credits

### The original game

*The Heart of Africa* (1985) was created by **Ozark Softscape** and published
by **Electronic Arts**. It was the follow-up to *The Seven Cities of Gold*
(1984).

- **Danielle Bunten Berry** (credited on the 1985 release as Dan Bunten) — design
  and programming
- **David Warhol** — music and sound effects
- **Electronic Arts** — publisher

This remake exists because that game was worth remembering. All credit for the
concept, the design and the original score belongs to the people above.

### This remake

Developed by **Patrick von Massow**. Source code, assets and text in this
repository are original work unless noted otherwise.

### Data and libraries

- Elevation data derived from public **Terrarium** terrain tiles
- Hydrology and place-name research from public-domain and openly licensed
  period sources
