# Maximum QA — the maximum quality-assurance pass

A single, repeatable, **token-frugal** quality gate that bundles every QA
technique the project has built up (points 173, 184, 195–200, 203/203A, 204,
205, 207). It is the pass to run before promoting a build to a public demo.

**No ultracode / no large agent fan-outs.** Ultracode workflows burn the
session/weekly token budget in minutes. Maximum QA runs as ordinary inline
work: sequential checks, the driven visual sweep inspected in the main loop, and
at most a *single* background subagent for model-diverse audit (Fable vs. the
author) whose findings are always harvested and verified inline. See the memory
`workflows-token-budget`.

Run the phases **in the order below**. Each real finding becomes its own atomic
TASKS point + commit (append at the end of the queue, per
`new-tasks-append-and-defer`). Fix everything found; the final closing (Phase 8)
must pass clean before any tag.

## Why this order

- **Coherence first (Phase 1), because it can REBUILD the game.** The
  world/functionality audit produces design changes and objective fixes; running
  the expensive detection (bug-finder, visual sweep, fuzzing, soak) before the
  rebuild would test a state that is about to change, and the golden-image
  baseline would be baked stale. So the coherence pass — and the fixes it agrees
  with the user — come first, and *every other phase then tests the rebuilt
  state* (user decision 21.07.2026).
- **Baseline next (Phase 2):** cheaply confirm the rebuild left the tree green
  before investing in deep detection.
- **Invariants armed early (Phase 3):** they are a force multiplier — once armed,
  every later automated phase AND every manual play session becomes a detector,
  so arm/extend them before the heavy detection phases.
- **WebGPU infrastructure before the sweeps (Phase 4):** some bugs are
  WebGPU-only (crown jitter, silhouette float), so the two-backend wiring must be
  in place before the visual sweep and the closing, or those phases silently miss
  a whole class.
- **Code audit before the finder (Phase 5):** a fresh-model read of the rebuilt
  code surfaces bugs the automated finder is not shaped to catch; fixing them
  first means the finder and sweep validate a cleaner state.
- **Finder, then the extra methods (Phases 6–7):** the finder is the primary net;
  the golden-image baseline (7 ii) can only be baked once the game is
  coherence- and finder-stable, so the differential/fuzz/soak methods layer on
  after it.
- **Closing last (Phase 8):** the full 3×-flake-free regression on both backends
  proves the fully-fixed state, immediately before the tag.

---

## Phase 1 — World & functionality coherence audit (FIRST — may rebuild the game)
- A model-diverse (Fable-lens) read of design.md + the §7.1 systems: does each
  system have a PURPOSE, real USE in the loop, COHERENCE with the others,
  SETTING FIT (~1890 accuracy), and WORTH? Plus world plausibility (ecology,
  economy, exploration, survival, cross-system loop).
- **Design judgments are the USER's call** — write them up and DISCUSS; only
  clear objective incoherences (a predator with no prey, an item with no effect,
  two contradictory rules) are filed as fix-points.
- Apply the agreed objective fixes and user-decided design changes now (the
  point-208 style of work), updating design.md/CLAUDE.md. **This is where the
  game may be rebuilt**; everything below tests the rebuilt state. Extend the
  in-game invariant set (Phase 3) for any system this rebuild changes.

## Phase 2 — Baseline regression (confirm the rebuild is green)
- `npm run build`, `npm run lint` (oxlint, zero errors/warnings), `npm audit`
  (zero CVEs), `npm run test:unit` (the fast Vitest layer) — all green.
- Run the LARGE browser regression (`npm test`) once to establish the baseline
  for the rebuilt state. Record any rotating staging flakes separately (they are
  not findings; a clean single retry confirms them).

## Phase 3 — In-game invariant assertions (the force multiplier, 207 i)
- Ensure the dev-only `devAssert` channel is armed and its invariants current:
  no animal/prop rendered below its own ground (the point-203A anchoring
  tripwire, judged at the logical render spot), no NaN/Infinity position, every
  started drama carries a deadline (I4), a lake sheet never below its bed, herd
  counts bounded, nothing standing on impassable ocean.
- A violation fires `console.error` → every suite's console-error gate fails, so
  every run and every manual play session becomes a detector. Extend the
  invariant set for any system the Phase-1 rebuild changed.

## Phase 4 — WebGPU coverage universal (infrastructure for the sweeps, 204)
- Every render/pixel suite calls `assertBackend` so it cannot silently fall back
  to WebGL2 under `VERIFY_GL=webgpu`.
- Wire the LARGE tier to run the render suites on BOTH backends (WebGL2 and the
  real system-Chrome WebGPU lane); touch/voice stay WebGL2-only (the documented
  headless exception). Resolve any WebGPU-only reds. In place now so the visual
  sweep (Phase 6) and the closing (Phase 8) genuinely cover both backends.

## Phase 5 — Code audit with model diversity
- Sweep the subsystems (systems/state, travel/world, render/ui/i18n) of the
  rebuilt code for test gaps AND real bugs, reading it against the design.
- Mix in a **different model than the recent author** for a blind pass (e.g. a
  single Fable subagent when the batch runs on Opus, or vice versa) — fresh
  blind spots find more (memory `audit-with-model-diversity`). ONE agent,
  harvested and every finding re-verified inline before it is filed.
- **Leak & accumulation code-review class (point 285, prong A):** the same
  fresh-model pass explicitly sweeps for the dispose/prune/re-seed/effect-cleanup
  bug family — three.js resources created but never disposed (`renderer.info.memory`
  must be flat at a fixed state), module-level Map/Set/array caches that only grow,
  streaming/respawn that re-adds without truncating the previous fill (the point-278
  class), and React effects with missing/wrong cleanup. Each finding gets a pure
  convergence test that FAILS on the old behaviour.
- File each confirmed bug as its own point; add the missing tests.

## Phase 6 — The systematic bug-finder (203)
Cheap automated classes first, then the visual sweep:
- **(A) Anchoring** — rendered body vs. terrain at its own anchor (buried/
  floating), incl. posed wing/limb extents and water-surface occupants; static
  water bodies vs. their beds.
- **(B) Liveness** — no actor frozen/oscillating in a live state past a
  deadline; no predator idling within touch range of live prey.
- **(D) Cross-system / targeting** — each emergent system owns a unique actor
  (no two claim one); every reaction keyed to its correct trigger.
- **(E) Visible-effect** ("the picture, not the uniform") — each state toggle
  (season, rain, flood, harmattan, fire, dress, bleach) changes the RENDERED
  frame in pixels where it should and does not leak where it must not.
- **(F–N) cheap extras** — facing tracks velocity; scale/proportion in band;
  no static-object interpenetration; no black/magenta pixels or z-fight; river
  continuity/monotonic descent; no teleport/frozen-phase.
- **(C) The driven visual filmstrip sweep — the PRIMARY net, inspected by me.**
  A principled sample (not the full cross product) over the dimensions:
  location, situation/drama, month, year 1890–1895, **backend (WebGL2 + real
  WebGPU)**, movement (static vs. a driven filmstrip), **zoom** (achievable
  0.25–0.5 AND the unlocked wide debug zooms), **scene** (bird's-eye travel AND
  first-person settlements + the transition), player state (canoe ridden/dragged,
  wounded, swimming), heading. Sampling = cost-split (dense on the cheap
  automated axes, sparse-but-smart on my visual inspection) + causally-located
  effects at their known coordinates (peak month + off month + one transition) +
  a pairwise (2-wise) covering array over the generic dimensions + risk-weighted
  over hot spots (coasts, water edges, dramas, recently-changed code) with
  adaptive densification around any anomaly. At each spot DRIVE and let dramas
  play out; capture a temporal filmstrip; I inspect every frame and the deltas.
  Judge "in view" by projecting to the frame (`__camera.onScreen`/`ndc`), never
  an assumed radius (memory `test-realistic-zoom`).
  KEEP THE EYES OPEN FOR "LOOKS-WRONG" ODDITIES (user directive 21.07.2026): the
  inspection must catch things that are functionally FINE but look WEIRD to a
  human — the aesthetic/plausibility class (a stepped coastline, a sea-arm poking
  into the desert, a river ending in a beach gap, a notch in the water, jagged
  edges/seams/holes, wrong scale or colour). These pass every functional check,
  so only the eye finds them; ask "does this look right to a human?" on every
  frame and file each real one as its own point.

## Phase 7 — Additional finding methods (207 ii–vii)
- **(ii) Golden-image differential** — bake the baseline of the sweep frames NOW
  (the game is coherence- and finder-stable); future runs diff against it and
  flag unintended pixel changes.
- **(iii) Property fuzzing + distribution checks** — thousands of random states
  through the cheap invariants; assert distributions (hunt directions, calf
  ratios, outcomes, spawn counts) are not degenerate.
- **(iv) Soak/endurance — the leak & accumulation runtime harness (point 285,
  prong B).** A long fast-forward sim with the invariants live, driving the game
  over TIME (repeated jumps/round-trips, long driving, repeated place enter/leave
  mount-unmount cycles) and asserting the measured quantities CONVERGE rather than
  grow: scene-graph triangle/mesh counts per system, `renderer.info.memory`
  geometries/textures, `performance.memory` JS heap, instanced and listener counts.
  A monotonic rise beyond a small tolerance over N cycles is a finding (this is what
  would have caught point 278 — the count grew while every one-moment test passed).
  A re-runnable script (`scripts/verify/leaks.mjs` or the documented harness), on
  both backends where the metric is backend-relevant.
- **(v) Metamorphic relations** — A→B→A returns to the same state (the point-278
  witness: same anchor, same seed, same instance count however long the session ran);
  the same scene at two zooms shows the same animals; month X and X+12 match;
  leave-and-re-enter is stable.
- **(vi) Automated player-journey** — many seeds/strategies; the goal stays
  reachable, the hint cascade leads there, no softlock, the deadline beatable.
- **(vii) Console/telemetry mining** — scan every run's console for warnings /
  NaN / shader-recompile / dropped-frame / deprecation noise; fail on new ones.

## Phase 8 — Final closing
- Fix every finding from Phases 1–7 (each its own commit, pushed).
- Dead-code / stale-doc / stale-comment cleanup as separate commits; audit every
  `.md` for accreted cruft (preserve section numbers). Keep the implementation
  sections current (`implementation-sections-current`).
- **Graphics detail-level doc current (user 24.07.2026):** explicitly confirm
  `docs/graphics-detail-levels.md` still matches `QUALITY_PRESETS`. The
  `src/config/qualityDoc.test.ts` sync test enforces it on every Vitest run (a
  green regression proves it), but name the check here so a preset/doc drift is
  never assumed away.
- Full regression again: build + lint + audit + Vitest + the LARGE browser set
  on BOTH backends, **3× flake-free** (a single retry may clear a rotating
  staging flake; a persistent fail is a real regression).
- **Cross-browser & mobile smoke at `thorough` depth** (point 213): the
  `crossbrowser.mjs` functional smoke on Firefox + WebKit (desktop) AND the touch
  layer on WebKit-iOS + Chromium-Android (mobile/tablet) — NEVER the whole suite
  per engine (that multiplies the runtime by the engine count), only the tiered
  core-flow subset. Skips gracefully if the engines are not installed.

## Phase 9 — Tag & publish the demo (binding release mechanism, user 24.07.2026)
- **Preconditions, both required before ANY version tag:** (1) the full closing
  run (Phase 8 — LARGE regression on BOTH backends, flake-free) is green on the
  exact commit; (2) the user has given explicit approval for THIS tag (per
  `tags-only-on-request`). No tag without both.
- **ENFORCED (point 306):** the closing checklist is machine-checked — the
  PreToolUse guard `scripts/closing-guard.mjs` DENIES the tag/poc create-or-push
  until EVERY closing step (Phase 8, incl. the dead-code/stale-doc/stale-comment
  cleanup + `.md` audit) is recorded done for the commit
  (`node scripts/closing-guard.mjs --status` / `--step <id> --evidence "…"`). A
  closing can no longer silently skip a step, which is what happened at v0.2.
  The same checklist gates the OTHER release act: the `[ ]`→`[x]` TICK of a point
  whose own spec delivers a closing (the point-224 shape) is denied on the
  work-order edit while a step is unrecorded — the tick IS the machine-readable
  "the closing is done" claim, and at v0.2 it was made while the cleanup had
  never run. A step the user expressly waives is recorded AS the waiver, naming
  his decision, so the waiver leaves a trace instead of a gap.
- Increment the trailing version digit (v0.1 → v0.2 → v0.3, …).
- Tag the release, and **MOVE the `poc` tag to the SAME commit** — `poc` always
  mirrors the NEWEST version tag (user decision 24.07.2026), playable at
  `…/Heart-of-Africa-Remake/poc/`. Both `/<version>/` and `/poc/` are served (the
  deploy workflow enumerates every `v*` tag + `poc` dynamically).
- The `/poc/` and `/<version>/` rebuild does NOT trigger on a tag push — after the
  tag moves, run the deploy (`workflow_dispatch`) or land a `main` push AFTER the
  tags, then VERIFY both URLs serve the new state. Then freeze.

## Keep the retrospective current — the refresh script + the currency guard

The collaboration retrospective (`docs/analysis_de/retrospektive-zusammenarbeit.md`,
git-ignored, German) records the recurring problem classes and their hardened
solutions. Its own lesson #1 — reminders do not keep documents current, only
enforcement does — applies to the document itself, so its currency is
**enforced**:

- **`scripts/retro-refresh.mjs`** scans the durable problem/solution-history
  sources — the feedback/project memories in the project memory dir, the
  guard/hook scripts in `scripts/` (each guard = a hardened solution), the git
  revert trail, and the process/meta TASKS points — and regenerates the
  marker-delimited `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED:START/END -->` section of the doc (a
  machine-maintained table: problem class, #attempts, heuristic severity,
  matching guard measure, status), recording a sources fingerprint + a
  "last refreshed" timestamp. The analysis prose outside the markers is never
  touched; an absent doc gets a minimal skeleton.
- **`scripts/retro-currency-guard.mjs`** (Stop hook) recomputes the
  fingerprint at every turn end and BLOCKS while it differs from the doc's
  recorded one — a new/edited memory, a new guard, a fresh revert or a
  process TASKS change forces the refresh **plus a review whether a NEW
  problem class needs its own prose paragraph** before the turn can end.
  No-ops when the doc is absent or `.claude/batch-paused` exists; stands down
  for non-owner sessions; fail-OPEN on any internal error.
- Shared logic: `scripts/retro-core.mjs` (pure, Vitest-covered in
  `scripts/retro-core.test.mjs`) + `scripts/retro-sources.mjs` (the one
  fs/git collector both scripts use, so their fingerprints can never drift).
