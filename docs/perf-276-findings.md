# Point 276 — the bird's-eye framerate regression: measurements and findings

Measured 23./24.07.2026 on a clean, SOLO machine (single session, warm dev
server, vsync disabled), WebGPU backend, viewport 1440x900, zoom 0.5 — the
reachable default, not a debug wide zoom (CLAUDE.md §7.2, point 172).

## The instruments

| script | what it answers | noise |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scripts/perf-bench.mjs` | frame time (median/p95/p99) per render config × state, plus spike attribution against the point-272 burst probe | ±1.2 ms run to run |
| `scripts/perf-structure.mjs` | what the renderer SUBMITS per frame (draw calls, triangles, memory) | camera/culling dependent |
| `scripts/perf-breakdown.mjs` | per-system triangle breakdown of the live scene graph | none (counts) |
| `scripts/perf-bisect.sh` | one commit's frame time in the throwaway bench worktree | inherits the bench noise |
| `scripts/perf-lod-experiment.sh` | one terrain-LOD variant, priced for both time and geometry | inherits the bench noise |

MUST-DOs, learned the hard way:
1. **VSync OFF** or every run caps at ~60 fps and hides the true cost.
2. **Warm the server** — the first run against a fresh dev server stalls for
   seconds (p99 ~3200 ms). The bench discards a warm-up pass.
3. **SOLO** — no parallel agent, verify or second session.
4. **Judge structure by COUNTS, timing by REPEATS.** A single timing sample
   carries ±1.2 ms here, which is more than most levers are worth; a scene-graph
   triangle count carries none. Commit-level bisection by timing is therefore
   NOT reliable (a re-measured commit swung 5.70 → 4.60 → 4.40 ms) — the
   regression was found structurally instead.

## The regression is real and it is GEOMETRY

v0.1 (cfc2736, 15.07.) vs main (1f575a4, 23.07.), same harness:

| state | v0.1 | main | delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| savanna standing | 4.40 ms / 227 fps | 5.60 ms / 179 fps | +1.2 ms |
| desert standing (empty) | 4.20 ms / 238 fps | 5.40 ms / 185 fps | +1.2 ms |
| driving savanna | 6.90 ms / 145 fps | 8.70 ms / 115 fps | +1.8 ms |

The surcharge is the SAME in the empty desert as in the dense savanna, so it is
not wildlife and not content. The scene-graph breakdown (desert, triangles):

| system | v0.1 | main | factor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| terrain chunks | 425 114 | 847 076 | **1.99x** |
| flora / dressing | 107 788 | 260 030 | **2.41x** |
| rivers + water | 11 340 | 44 052 | 3.9x |
| climate (new) | — | 3 610 | new |
| sky | 1 216 | 1 216 | — |

### Where the terrain doubling comes from — exactly

Per-chunk triangle histogram in the Sahara (chunk counts by triangle count):

| segments | tris/chunk | v0.1 | main | refine off |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 20 (far ring) | 960 | 88 | 88 | 88 |
| 28 (mid ring) | 1 792 | 56 | 29 | 56 |
| 56 (near ring) | 6 720 | 25 | 37 | 25 |
| **112 (refined)** | **25 984** | **0** | **15** | **0** |
| terrain total | | 352 832 | 774 848 | 352 832 |

The whole difference is point 209's near-ring refinement (`refinedSegments` in
`src/scenes/travel/terrainLod.ts`): a near chunk that is coastal OR carries more
than `MOUNTAIN_CHUNK_RELIEF_M` (400 m) of relief doubles its segments, which
QUADRUPLES its triangles. The threshold's own comment records that 400 m marks
**60 % of all land chunks** — so the "targeted" refinement is in practice
near-universal. Switching it off reproduces v0.1's histogram exactly.

## What each lever is worth ON THIS MACHINE

| lever | savanna | desert | driving | verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| baseline (main) | 5.60 | 5.40 | 8.70 | — |
| TRAA off | 5.80 | 5.30 | 8.10 | no win |
| SSAO off | 5.90 | 5.70 | 8.40 | no win |
| shadows off | 6.30 | 5.40 | 8.50 | no win |
| shadow map half | 5.90 | 5.60 | 8.50 | no win |
| all post off | 5.80 | 5.40 | 8.20 | no win |
| everything off | 5.90 | 5.70 | 8.40 | no win |
| device pixel ratio 2 (4x pixels) | 5.50 | 7.90 | 8.60 | barely moves — not fill-rate bound |
| wildlife behaviour LOD (N1) | — | slower | 9.4 vs 9.1 | no win, parked |
| **terrain refine OFF** | **5.20** | **5.00** | **8.10** | **the only real win: ~0.4-0.6 ms (~8 %)** |
| refine rings 0-2 only | 5.80 | 5.00 | 8.60 | little — the 15 near chunks are the cost |
| flora radius 260 -> 170 | 5.40 | 5.00 | 8.60 | rejected: p99 while driving 12 -> 48 ms |

### Consequences

- **The render features are not the problem.** Everything the debug menu can
  switch off is worth almost nothing here; an F9 "Low Details" mode built out of
  those switches would buy the user nothing on hardware like this.
- **The p99 "hitch" trail was a measurement artifact.** A short 6 s sample once
  showed p99 38 ms; 12 s samples put every config at 12-13 ms with a single
  ~28 ms outlier, and the point-272 burst probe attributes ~0 ms of it to
  terrain/flora rebuilds (terrain max 0.3 ms, flora max 0.6 ms per burst). The
  streaming work is genuinely cheap now.
- **Absolute framerates here are high** (179-238 fps standing, 115 fps driving).
  This headless GPU is NOT geometry-bound, which is exactly why doubling the
  geometry costs it only 8 %. A slower or more geometry-bound GPU can pay far
  more for the same doubling — so the numbers that decide which lever ships must
  come from the USER's real hardware, not from here.

## Therefore: the in-game benchmark (user's request, 24.07.2026)

Measure on the real machine, in the DELIVERED build, deterministically — same
route, same seed, same date, same events, with only the graphics config varying
between runs — and hand back a downloadable report. That is point 277.

### The method it uses (F8, design.md §21.1)

| piece | how |
| --- | --- |
| route | the three states above, same anchors as `perf-bench.mjs`: savanna (-2.5, 34.0) standing, desert (23.0, 15.0) standing, driving out of the savanna |
| configs | baseline, traa-off, ssao-off, shadows-off, shadow-half, post-off, dpr-1, terrain-refine-off, terrain-cap-84, all-off |
| determinism | a seeded PRNG replaces `Math.random` for the run (restored in a `finally`); seed, date, position, travel speed, zoom, journal and the event/deadline switches are reset before EVERY section |
| **fixed step** | R3F's frame clock is pinned (`installFixedClock`): every `useFrame` gets dt = 1/60 s and `elapsedTime` advances once per frame, and each section runs a FIXED FRAME COUNT — so the simulated path, the streaming crossings and every roll are identical across configs and only the wall clock varies |
| warm-up | one discarded pass over the whole route, so the cold caches (terrain geometry, flora, shader compiles) do not land on whichever config runs first |
| metrics | THREE series — **real GPU time** from the WebGPU backend's timestamp queries, the CPU time inside the frame (between R3F's before/after render effects) and the wall-clock frame interval — plus `renderer.info` draw calls/triangles and a scene-graph triangle count per system |
| GPU time | `backend.trackTimestamp = true` for the run (three requests every adapter-supported feature at device creation, so `timestamp-query` is already enabled where the hardware has it), then `renderer.resolveTimestampsAsync('render')` per frame; it returns the summed GPU duration of the last frame in the batch, so a phase collects one sample per resolve round-trip (`gpu.n` in the report). Missing feature or a throwing resolve ⇒ the series is marked unavailable WITH a reason and the run continues |
| terrain levers | module-level runtime overrides in `src/scenes/travel/terrainLod.ts` (`setTerrainRefine`), which change the chunk geometry KEYS and therefore rebuild by themselves; restored after the run |

**Reading the numbers.** A page cannot disable vsync, so a config that is
comfortably fast reads as a flat ~16.7 ms and the wall clock cannot separate the
levers (flagged per row as `vsyncLikely`). That matters more than it sounds: the
regression above is GEOMETRY, i.e. a GPU cost — a config 40 % more expensive on
the GPU moves NEITHER a capped wall clock NOR the CPU time, so a CPU-only report
would say "no difference" for exactly the lever in question. Hence the GPU
series, and hence the report names its own headline (`headline`, also written
into the digest and shown in the result panel):

| headline | when | what it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gpu` | GPU timestamps resolved | read the GPU column — vsync-independent, the real cost of the lever |
| `wall` | no timestamps, wall clock NOT capped | the frame column measures end to end |
| `cpu` | no timestamps AND a capped wall clock | only the CPU column carries information, and the GPU cost is NOT measured — do not read this run as a verdict on a geometry lever |

The headless WebGL 2 lane always lands in the third case, which is why the
in-game run on the user's WebGPU machine is the one that decides.

### First results from the instrument itself (headless WebGPU, 24.07.2026)

Two things showed up the moment the benchmark measured geometry rather than
render features:

1. **The terrain lever really is worth its 2x.** With the refinement off, the
   desert scene graph drops from **847 074 to 425 058** triangles — the v0.1
   histogram of the table above, reproduced live and now switchable at runtime.
   (It also caught its own wiring bug: the first version passed the override
   under a mis-named key, so the lever silently did nothing while every test
   stayed green. The gate now asserts the RENDERED triangle drop, not the
   config object.)
2. **RESOLVED (point 278) — the dressing crept upward over a session, and it
   was WILDLIFE, not flora.** At a FIXED desert anchor, with a fixed seed and a
   fixed date, the instanced dressing under `travel-dressing` grew every round
   trip: 235 808 → 327 808 triangles over five round trips (mesh count constant),
   252 766 → 354 958 across one benchmark run.

   **Diagnosis (measured, not guessed).** The `travel-dressing` group holds TWO
   instanced-mesh families: the flora streaming (`MeshStandardNodeMaterial`, 14
   meshes) and the wildlife pools (`MeshStandardMaterial`, ~22 meshes). The
   point-276 breakdown groups by named ancestor, so both landed in one
   "flora/dressing" row and the growth read as flora. Splitting them by material
   at a fixed anchor over six round trips showed the **flora bit-stable** (206 946
   tris / 2 742 instances, IDENTICAL every trip) and the **wildlife instance count
   climbing monotonically** (live animals 7 → 11 → 14 → 17 → 22, ~+12 per round
   trip; the live enrichments check reproduced it as `samples:[7,11,14,17,22]`).

   **Root cause.** `keepStreamedAnimal` (design.md §19.4) re-homes a roamer whose
   birth chunk despawned into the live cell under its feet — it OUTLIVES its birth
   chunk. The despawn pass then freed that birth chunk's key by DISTANCE alone, so
   a later return re-entered the spawn ring and `spawnChunk` re-seeded the SAME
   deterministic animals — a second copy, while the re-homed original still lived.
   Over a session of ordinary back-and-forth this duplicates ~one animal per
   re-home per round trip: unbounded growth at a fixed anchor. The code had flagged
   exactly this as a "known pre-existing property … inherent to deterministic
   chunk respawn".

   **Fix.** Animals carry an immutable `origin` (birth chunk, pinned at the first
   re-home); the pure `retainedSpawnChunks` (wildlifeBehavior.ts) keeps a chunk key
   in the spawned set as long as ANY living animal still originates there, so the
   respawn never re-seeds a chunk whose animals are already alive. The animal CULL
   still judges membership by the IN-RANGE set (`has(key) && !beyondDespawn`),
   identical to before, so a chunk retained only for its origin never stalls a
   legitimate despawn. Returning to a fixed anchor now converges to a constant
   count (live check `spread:0`). Pure regression witness:
   `retainedSpawnChunks` in `src/scenes/travel/wildlifeBehavior.test.ts` (the
   pre-278 path grows without bound, the fix converges); live gate: "the streamed
   dressing does not grow over a session at a fixed anchor (point 278)" in
   `scripts/verify/enrichments.mjs`.

   **The fate of `feat/278-dressing-growth` — verdict, 30.07.2026 (point 329 (b)).**
   The branch-cleanup of 25.07.2026 removed 133 merged branches and 26 orphaned
   worktrees but held two back whose unmerged work had to be JUDGED rather than
   deleted; this was the second of them, believed to carry an alternative fix plus
   enrichments checks and pure tests that main might lack. It carries nothing main
   lacks. Its tip was recovered from a dangling commit (`afab68d5`, 24.07. 10:15) —
   the branch itself was already gone locally and from GitHub — and `git diff`
   between that tip and main's `cc11bb1b` (24.07. 10:19, four minutes later) is
   EMPTY: the same tree, re-committed onto main. Line by line, all 222 substantive
   lines it added across the five files (the five `retainedSpawnChunks` cases, the
   live enrichments gate, `Wildlife.tsx`, `wildlifeBehavior.ts` and this document)
   are present in main verbatim. So there is no check to salvage, nothing landed, and
   nothing to re-verify. Both branches of point 329 are now closed: (a) retired
   unmerged with its lever moved to point 310, (b) closed as a duplicate of what
   shipped.

## The campfire shadow map (point 289) — measured verdict, 24.07.2026

The village fire light can cast a cube shadow map (design.md §19.10, debug
toggle "Campfire shadows", OFF by default). Measured with the perf-bench
method (vsync off, warm dev server, SOLO) but in the FIRST-PERSON Maasai
village, standing at the fire pit — the state the feature affects; the travel
anchors above never mount a fire. Wall-clock frame medians, 6 s samples,
repeated runs (the usual ±1.2 ms machine noise applies):

| config | WebGPU | WebGL 2 | draw calls |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| fire shadows off | 2.1–3.6 ms (median ~2.9) | 3.1–3.5 ms | ~220–240 |
| on, 128² cube map | +1.4 ms | — | ~390 |
| on, 256² cube map (shipped) | +1.4–1.6 ms | +1.3 ms | ~400 |
| on, 512² cube map | +1.5 ms | — | ~400 |

Findings:

1. **The map resolution is NOT the cost.** 128/256/512 are indistinguishable
   within noise — the price is the ~170 extra draw calls of the SIX cube-face
   shadow passes (per-face frustum culling over the casters within the light's
   14 m range), not map fill. The shipped size is therefore 256 (quality is
   free); a "cheap blob-shadow approximation" would buy nothing measurable and
   was not built.
2. **Both backends carry it, zero console errors**, and the picture gate holds
   on both (`scripts/verify/polish.mjs`, screenshot 138: behind-stone vs
   beside-stone contrast 3–12 off, 40–58 on).
3. **Affordability verdict (headless): acceptable as an OPT-IN, not as a
   default.** +1.5 ms is real money on this rig (~8 % of a driving travel
   frame), but it applies only inside villages, where the scene is otherwise
   cheap (place scene ran 280–450 fps here with shadows off, ~190–270 fps on).
4. **The user's hardware gives the real verdict** — its budget is fill-rate and
   post (see docs/perf-277-user-hardware.md), and six small cube-face passes
   are draw/geometry work, exactly what that GPU shrugs at, so the expected
   real-world cost is well under the headless number. The F8 benchmark routes
   only bird's-eye states and cannot price a settlement feature: judge it with
   the FPS counter standing at a village fire, toggle on vs off. If it proves
   cheap, making it the default is a one-flag change (`fireShadowsEnabled`).
