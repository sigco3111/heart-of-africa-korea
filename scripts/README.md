# Geodata Preprocessing (design.md §3 "Real geodata and terrain rendering")

The runtime assets under `public/geodata/` are produced fully reproducibly
by these scripts (Node ≥ 20, no npm dependencies):

```
node scripts/build-geodata.mjs              # DEM: public/geodata/dem.png + dem.json
node scripts/generate-terrain-textures.mjs  # terrain textures: public/geodata/tex/*.png
node scripts/generate-surface-textures.mjs  # settlement surfaces: public/tex/*.png
```

## build-geodata.mjs — real elevation model

1. Downloads Terrarium elevation tiles (zoom 6, 224 tiles ≈ 10 MB) for the
   Africa bounding box from the public AWS Open Data bucket
   `elevation-tiles-prod` (Mapzen/Linux Foundation; composite of SRTM,
   GMTED2010 and GEBCO bathymetry; no authentication). Tiles are cached in
   `scripts/.tile-cache/` (gitignored).
2. Resamples the Web-Mercator tiles bilinearly onto an equirectangular grid
   (0.025° ≈ 2.8 km; matching the game's flat lat/lon world mapping),
   bounding box longitude −20…53, latitude −37…38.
3. Ocean mask via flood fill from the map border over elevations ≤ 0 m —
   below-sea-level depressions (Qattara, Afar) thus remain land. Afterwards
   all game settlements (parsed from `src/world/geo.ts`) are stamped as
   land if they sit on sub-pixel islands (only Cape Town was affected).
4. Chamfer distance transform to the coast for the shore ramps.
5. Encoded as one opaque RGB PNG (`dem.png`, custom PNG encoder with the
   "Up" filter): R/G = (elevation m + 12000) as 16 bit, B = 0 for ocean or
   1 + coast distance/0.02°. Elevations are quantized for compression
   (land 4 m, shallow water 8 m, deep sea 50 m). Metadata in `dem.json`.

At runtime `src/world/geodata.ts` loads the PNG (native browser decode)
and provides bilinear samplers; `src/world/hydro.ts` supplies exact
distances to the authored ~1890 river/lake courses (Catmull-Rom densified,
bucket grid — no rasterization).

## generate-terrain-textures.mjs — ground materials

Deterministically generates tileable albedo and normal maps (256²,
periodic value/Worley noise) for sand, grass, rock and forest canopy. They
are blended in the terrain material (TravelScene) via vertex splat
weights; steep slopes receive bi-planar projected rock.

## generate-surface-textures.mjs — settlement surfaces

Same pattern at 512² for the first-person settlement materials (plaster,
mud daub, thatch, wood, trodden ground), written to `public/tex/`. The
shared noise fields and bake loop live in `textureFields.mjs`; their exact
tileability and normal normalisation are pinned by
`src/render/surfaceTextures.test.ts`. At runtime the maps are sampled
world-space triplanar with mip/anisotropy band-limiting
(`src/render/materials.ts`).

## png.mjs

Dependency-free PNG codec (decode: 8-bit gray/RGB/RGBA non-interlaced;
encode: 8-bit RGB), used by all three generators.

# Verification Suite (CLAUDE.md §7.2)

`scripts/verify/` holds the headless acceptance checks (Playwright is a
devDependency; Chromium via `npx playwright install chromium`). Every script
exits non-zero on failure and writes screenshot evidence to `verification/`.

The whole regression runs with one command:

```
npm test              # scripts/verify/run-all.mjs: type-check + build, oxlint,
                      # the fast Vitest layer (jsdom), then the browser suites
                      # against a managed dev server, then the
                      # production-preview smoke test
npm test -- flow      # a single suite (dev server managed for you)
npm test -- build lint  # just the build + lint preflight
```

`npm test` exits non-zero if any stage fails or a suite logs a browser console
error. The Playwright suites are: `docs` (README/CLAUDE.md consistency),
`world`, `i18n`, `flow`, `health`, `events`, `collision`, `handwriting`,
`polish`, `gamepad`, `touch`, `voice`, `settings`, `enrichments`,
`invariants`, `benchmark`, and `preview` (the production build). Each maps to
the CLAUDE.md §7.1 criteria named in its
header comment. The bulk of the regression (pure logic, store transitions,
HTML-HUD components) runs in the Vitest layer (`npm run test:unit`); the
layer split and the old→new coverage map live in
[`scripts/verify/README.md`](verify/README.md).

`npm test` manages its own servers: each run's dev/preview server binds an
**auto-assigned free port** (never the default :5173/:4173) and passes it to
the suites via `BASE_URL`, so a manual `npm run dev` you leave open on :5173
can be started, used and terminated at any time without ever colliding with a
regression. A single suite can also be run directly against a manual server:
`node scripts/verify/<name>.mjs` hits `BASE_URL` (default :5173), so start
`npm run dev` first (except `docs`, which needs no server, and `preview`,
which needs a `npm run build && npm run preview` on :4173).

Notes:

- The dev-server checks rely on DEV-only hooks (`__game`, `__ui`,
  `__placePlayer`, `__placeLayout`, `__placeColliders`, `__placeCamera`,
  `__placeWalkers`, `__placeBackdrop`, `__placeBackdropInfo`, `__balance`,
  `__movement`, `__events`, `__lionHunt`, `__wildlife`, `__player`, `__rivers`,
  `__culturalLandmarks`, `__terrainType`, `__setLang`, `__voiceMarkup`);
  they do not work against the production build.
- Chromium must run with `--enable-gpu` and the ANGLE backend its PLATFORM can
  provide — `--use-angle=d3d11` on Windows, and on Linux whatever the host's GPU
  offers (`VERIFY_ANGLE=gl`). The verify suites pick it themselves (point 475,
  `scripts/verify/launch-args-core.mjs`); the perf tools here still hard-code the
  Windows flag. Beware the SwiftShader fallback — the only backend a GPU-less
  container can run: requestAnimationFrame drops to ~1 fps and interaction tests
  become meaninglessly slow, so a machine that verifies pictures wants a real GPU.
- The default language is English (design.md §17); suites that assert
  German strings switch the language explicitly via `__setLang`. Journal
  entries are asserted by their language-neutral keys.
