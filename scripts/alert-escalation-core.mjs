// THE ESCALATION LADDER (point 434, the remainder of part 1) — the pure half.
//
// WHY. `.github/workflows/batch-watchdog.yml` alerts every 30 minutes while the
// repository has not moved, and it shares the ntfy topic with the CI-red alert.
// An alert that repeats unchanged every half hour is an alert that gets slept
// through: by the fourth identical buzz it carries no information, and the one
// thing it must not do — get quieter over the night — is exactly what it does to
// a reader. The night of 29./30.07.2026 ended with a stopped batch and a phone
// that had been notified.
//
// So a REPEATED IDENTICAL alert does not repeat identically. It climbs:
//
//   rung 0  send immediately          — the first time the condition is seen
//   rung 1  not before 15 min later
//   rung 2  not before 30 min later
//   rung 3  not before 60 min later   — priority rises with the rung
//   rung 4  not before 120 min later  — AND THE BATCH PAUSES, with a board card
//   above   silence: the batch is paused and the reason is written down
//
// Four buzzes over ~3.5 hours instead of eight identical ones, then a state the
// morning reader cannot miss. The LAST RUNG IS THE POINT: an alert can be slept
// through, a paused batch with a card explaining itself cannot.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS "IDENTICAL". The watchdog's message carries a rising minute
// count, so a byte comparison would call every buzz a new alert and the ladder
// would never leave rung 0. Digit runs therefore collapse in the key: "stalled
// for 121 minutes" and "stalled for 151 minutes" are ONE alert, "CI is red" is
// another.
//
// FAIL-OPEN MEANS SEND. Everywhere else in this repository fail-open means "let
// the session act". On an alerting path it means DELIVER: an escalation state
// that cannot be read must never swallow a message. The I/O half enforces that;
// this half only decides.

/**
 * THE PAUSE RUNG IS FOR CONDITIONS, NOT FOR EVENTS (four-eyes review, blocker).
 *
 * The ladder's premise — "the same alert again means the same condition is still

 * a wedged owner. It is FALSE for an EVENT notification: `batch-autostart` posts
 * "Resurrected" on every successor spawn, which under the context-boundary
 * policy is the designed HEALTHY flow several times a night, and its text is
 * identical once digit runs collapse. Simulated at a 45-minute point cadence it
 * reaches the last rung after ~5 hours and would pause a perfectly healthy batch
 * — the exact opposite of this layer's purpose, and the 6-hour reset never fires
 * on a busy night.
 *
 * So pausing requires the CALLER's own declared priority to be at least this.
 * An event notification is posted at `low`/`default` and therefore CANNOT pause:
 * it throttles at the top gap and keeps going out for as long as it recurs,
 * rather than either pausing or falling permanently silent. Condition-shaped
 * callers already post at `high`/`urgent`. The gate reads the CALLER's priority,
 * never the rung's own raised one, which would defeat it.
