// Atomic JSON writes that survive a Windows moment (point 388, first live
// finding 28.07.2026).
//
// WHY: `.claude/boundary.log` recorded
//   FAIL-OPEN: the guard errored and allowed the stop
//   (EPERM: operation not permitted, rename batch-lock.json.tmp-9904 -> batch-lock.json)
// The write-to-temp + rename that makes a lock update atomic is not atomic
// against an antivirus scanner or the search indexer holding the TARGET file
// open for a few milliseconds — Windows answers EPERM or EBUSY, and on that path
// the guard failed open, which is right for a guard but meant the HANDOVER was
// silently not written. A handover that reports success while the lock keeps its
// old content is the failure of that night in a new costume.
//
// So the write RETRIES briefly, and the caller can ask whether it worked
// (`tryWriteJsonAtomic`) instead of only whether it threw. Pure decision parts
// (`isTransientWriteError`, the delay ladder) are dependency-injected and
// Vitest-covered in scripts/atomic-write.test.mjs.
