// OS-scheduler launcher (user mandate 22.07.2026) — resurrects a DEAD batch when
// nothing else can, and VERIFIES its own work / RAISES A SIGNAL when the batch
// is sick, not just dead. The launcher's TRIGGER runs this every few minutes: a
// Windows Scheduled Task there, the scripts/batch-launcher.mjs daemon on Linux
// (point 474). This file does not care which — only that it is ticked.
//
// HARD SINGLETON (24.07.2026, after the e9407cae incident — this launcher
// double-spawned against a live-but-heartbeat-starved interactive session):
//   - Liveness is judged by scripts/batch-singleton.mjs: heartbeat age AND a
//     REAL OS pid check. A session mid-long-tool-call (stale heartbeat, live
//     claude process) reads ALIVE — the old 12-min claimedAt window read it
//     dead and spawned the second session. A reboot alone is NOT death: only
//     a provably dead owner (dead/reused pid, heartbeat predating the boot,
//     or a legacy lock gone very stale) frees the lock.
//   - Spawning goes through the SAME ATOMIC acquire as every session: the
//     launcher first wins a 'pending-spawn' lock (test-and-set); only then
//     does it spawn, and the spawned session converts that lock to itself
//     (pid-bound). If the acquire loses (a session claimed in the race
//     window), NOTHING is spawned. No path overrides a live lock.
//   - ACTIVE DETECTOR + REMEDIATION: every tick it checks for a second live
//     top-level session. If its OWN previous spawn is live but is not the
//     owner, it KILLS that rogue spawn (it created it, it may reap it), logs
//     it and notifies. A rogue interactive session is never killed — the
//     guards make it stand down — but the user is notified urgently.
// Disable: `node scripts/batch-launcher.mjs --stop` (Linux) /
//          `Disable-ScheduledTask -TaskName HoA-Batch-Autostart` (Windows)
