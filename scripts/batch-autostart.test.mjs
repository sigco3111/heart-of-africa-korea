// `node -e "import('./scripts/batch-autostart.mjs')"` launched a session inside a
// git worktree during the work on point 373, and the spawned session claimed that
// worktree's batch lock before it could be killed.
//
// The file therefore throws unless it is the process entry point. This test is the

// effect, which is the property being pinned.
