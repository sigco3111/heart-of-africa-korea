// Pure core of the AUTONOMOUS SESSION BOUNDARY (user 27.07.2026).
//
// WHY: 80 % of the token spend sits above 150k context, because one batch
// session carries point after point. Run 24/7 that is the dominant cost
// (1.25 %/h of the weekly quota against the ~0.6 %/h that fits). The cure is the
// mechanism that already exists: the session ENDS at a point boundary and the OS
// LAUNCHER brings up a fresh one, which `batch-resume-hook`
// re-orients. Nothing new drives the batch — what changes is that ending is now
// a LEGAL way to finish a turn.
//
// The danger this core exists to remove is the obvious one: `batch-progress-guard`
// hard-blocks every turn end while open points remain, so without it the guard
// would block exactly the behaviour the change wants; and if the guard simply
// stopped blocking, a disabled launcher would strand the batch forever. So a
// boundary stop is legal only when BOTH hold:
//
//   1. The point the session claims to have closed is VERIFIABLY closed — gone
//      from TASKS.md's open list AND ticked in docs/tasks-archive.md. The claim
//      alone proves nothing; the work order is the authority.
//   2. The launcher is ARMED (the scheduled task's real state, probed, not
//      assumed). Unknown counts as NOT armed: erring toward "keep working" can
//      cost context, erring toward "stop" can cost the whole batch.
//
// POINT 388 (28.07.2026) corrects one assumption of the paragraph this replaces.
// The boundary used to end at "the stop is permitted": the lock was left to
// expire the honest way, on the reasoning that the old process dies within
// minutes. It does not. On the first live night a session ended its TURN and kept
// its PROCESS — an interactive window fires no SessionEnd, so nothing released
// the lock — and the launcher correctly refused to spawn a successor beside a
// live owner, 21 ticks in a row, for five and a half hours.
//
// So the boundary is now TAKEN rather than offered, in three parts:
//   - `boundaryDueFrom` below: a point closed IN THIS SESSION with no marker
//     recorded makes the guard BLOCK and name the command, instead of falling
//     through to a message where the boundary is one option among many.
//   - the Stop hook marks the lock HANDED OVER (scripts/batch-singleton.mjs
//     `markHandover`) at the moment it allows the stop, and only there. The
//     singleton stays intact: the handover is not an age heuristic but the
//     owner's own statement, it survives only while no further tool call bumps
//     the heartbeat past it, and a live pid still gets a grace window.
//   - the launcher REPORTS a silent owner instead of only logging it.
//
// The imports are NAMES, from two constants modules that import nothing: the
// board's commands (board-remedy) and the launcher's identity
// (batch-launcher-core). This core prints the instruction a session follows
// literally at a boundary, and a second spelling of those names here is how the
// printed path and the working path came apart in the first place.

// Taking the boundary writes a marker and marks the lock handed over; any
// further work withdraws it again, which is right in itself. But the Stop chain
// ROUTINELY sends a session back to work AFTER the boundary is taken — a missing
// timestamp, an unreviewed mechanism commit, a dashboard whose HEAD moved — and
// each of those rounds silently un-took the handover. The log shows it to the
// second: `HANDOVER point 378` at 08:56:12, `WITHDRAWN point 378` at 08:56:16.
// A boundary that only survives a turn with nothing left to do is not a
// mechanism, because finding something left to do is the Stop chain's purpose.
//
// So the withdrawal distinguishes work that CONTINUES the batch from work a Stop
// guard DEMANDED: the marker survives edits confined to the CLOSING SET — the
// board, the review ledger, the work order's own entry and the boundary's own
// bookkeeping — and anything else withdraws it. Deliberately conservative: an
// unrecognised tool, an unparseable command and a call with no target all
// withdraw. A wrongly withdrawn boundary costs one command to re-take; a wrongly
// KEPT one lets a successor spawn beside a working session, which is the
// incident class this whole apparatus exists to prevent.
