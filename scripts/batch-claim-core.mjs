// TAKING THE BATCH BACK INTO THE WINDOW THE USER IS SITTING AT (point 395,
// user 28.07.2026) — the decision half, pure and dependency-injected.
//
// WHY: the night belongs to fresh headless sessions, and that is where the
// context saving comes from. What was missing is the way BACK. The user returns
// to a window that has been silent for hours, types `/clear` and says "I am
// back" — and that window resolves as a non-owner and correctly STANDS DOWN
// (scripts/batch-resume-hook.mjs), while the night session keeps the lock and
// keeps working. There was no door.
//
// THE SHAPE, deliberately the one the boundary and the in-flight declaration
// already use: the returning window records a CLAIM; the live owner sees it at
// its next Stop hook, FINISHES what it is doing, and only then releases the lock;
// the claiming window acquires at its next check. With no owner at all the claim
// is satisfied at once — there is nobody to wait for.
//
// IT IS A REQUEST, NEVER A TRANSFER. Nothing here writes the lock: ownership is
// still gained ONLY through `acquire` in scripts/batch-singleton.mjs, whose
// test-and-set is what makes two racing claims resolve to exactly one owner. A
// claim can therefore never produce a second driving session — the failure this
// whole apparatus exists to prevent (the e9407cae incident).
//
// FOUR BOUNDS, each measurable rather than a matter of taste:
//   1. IT IS BOUNDED BY THE THING IT WAITS FOR, not by a clock somebody has to
//      feed (point 434 (6), 30.07.2026 — see `assessClaim`). A claim file left by
//      a window that was closed must never hand the batch to nobody, and the
//      reader that answers that is the pid probe of bound 2, not the calendar.
//      The wall clock survives only where there is nobody left to wait for: with
//      the lock free and the claim untaken, `CLAIM_MAX_AGE_MS` is the TAKE-UP
//      window after which the ordinary handover takes over again.
//   2. THE CLAIMANT MUST BE ALIVE, and alive by IDENTITY: the recorded pid must
//      exist AND have started when the claim says it did. A reused pid is a
//      stranger. This is the same rule `checkEvidence` applies to a declared
//      background run, and it reuses `resolveOwnership` for "is this claim mine"
//      rather than inventing a second notion of liveness beside the lock's.
//   3. ONE CLAIM AT A TIME. A second window cannot overwrite a live claim by a
//      first (`claimWriteDecision`), and even if both were somehow recorded, the
//      atomic acquire still admits exactly one owner.
//   4. THE OWNER RELEASES ONLY AT A CLEAN MOMENT. Never mid-merge, never with a
//      delegated agent still building or a verification running — the evidence
//      for that is `assessInFlight` (scripts/batch-in-flight-core.mjs), not a new
//      guess. A wrongly withheld release costs the user one more turn; a release
//      mid-merge costs the work.
//
// Where two verdicts are close this file chooses NOT to release: the owner
// keeping the batch for another turn is a nuisance, a half-finished merge is a
// repair job.

/** THE PICK-UP WINDOW, counted in LAUNCHER TICKS (point 446). The half of the
 *  handshake that lies with the other side is the pick-up, and the acquirer that
 *  can steal it is the launcher — so the window is expressed in the unit that
 *  measures that risk: how many ticks may pass before the launcher is allowed to
 *  take a freed lock for itself. Two is the smallest count that survives a tick
 *  falling immediately after the release, and a slower launcher lengthens the
 *  window with itself rather than losing it.
 *
 *  IT COUPLES IN BOTH DIRECTIONS (four-eyes review, Fable 5, finding 2). The same
 *  product is `CLAIM_MAX_AGE_MS`, which also bounds a claim NOBODY has released to
 *  yet and feeds the resume hook's stand-down text and the claim CLI — doors that
 *  have nothing to do with the tick. So a future SPEED-UP of `LAUNCHER_TICK_MS`
 *  shortens all of them: whoever changes the tick raises this count (or
 *  HOA_CLAIM_MAX_MIN) to keep the claim window where it belongs. The equality is
 *  pinned in scripts/batch-claim-core.test.mjs, so the change surfaces there. */

 * THE TAKE-UP WINDOW: how long a claim stays honourable once there is nobody
 * left to wait for — the lock free (or its owner gone) and the claim not yet

 * the batch ownerless. The same window bounds the reservation a RELEASED claim
 * holds on the freed lock (point 461), counted from the RELEASE — the moment
 * there is nobody left to wait for — so a window left open but never taking what
 * it asked for cannot hold the batch either. `HANDOVER_GRACE_MS` is deliberately
 * NOT reused for it: that one means the pid-alive handover before a successor
 * takeover, and overloading it would couple two calibrations.
 *
 * IT IS NO LONGER THE CLAIM'S LIFETIME (point 434 (6a), 30.07.2026). As a flat
 * expiry it was shorter than the owner's own gap between clean turn ends: the
 * owner is inside a 40-minute suite, the claim ages out unseen, the takeover
 * silently fails, and keeping it alive needed a background refresher that itself
 * died silently (measured 29.07.2026 20:00, session 10a2d2e0 — a watcher hit a
 * 60-minute timeout and the claim would have lapsed at 20:29 with nobody the
 * wiser). While a live owner still holds the lock the claim therefore does NOT
 * age: it is honoured for as long as the window that wrote it is alive, which is
 * a fact a probe reads rather than a deadline anybody feeds.
 *
 * IT IS TWO LAUNCHER TICKS (point 446, 30.07.2026). The number was a flat half
 * hour that happened to equal them; the incident it is measured against is a
 * launcher tick landing in the gap between a release and the claiming window's
 * next command, so the window is now DERIVED from the tick — a launcher slowed
 * down must not silently shrink the pick-up window to less than one tick.

 * record:
 *   - 10:10-10:16 — a record with `releasedAt` AND `releasedBy` set was still
 *     HONOURED. The owner released to it, the claiming window never took it, and
 *     the batch ran for an hour with NO lock while every guard behaved as though
 *     it were owned; the boundary that followed released to the same dead claim a
 *     second time (`.claude/boundary.log`: two RELEASED lines, no HANDOVER). So a
 *     released record is never honourable again — nothing releases to it twice.
 *   - 17:10-17:16 — reading it as plain ABSENT made it reserve nothing, so the
 *     RELEASING session re-acquired the lock it had just freed at its own next
 *     turn end (`acquiredAt` 17:11), and the user's window had to WIN A RACE
 *     against automated acquirers — which is exactly the window that is answering
 *     the user rather than polling. It lost by six minutes.
 * The resolution keeps both: unhonourable AND reserving. While its claimant is
 * PROVABLY alive — the same pid + start-time identity probe the honour path runs,
 * never a deadline — no OTHER window may take the freed lock (`reservationDecision`),
 * and the claimant's own path is untouched because the own-claim branch is asked
 * BEFORE this one. A dead or closed claimant frees the lock INSTANTLY, so the
 * batch can never idle out a reservation, and the take-up window (`maxAgeMs`,
 * counted from the RELEASE — that is the moment there is nobody left to wait for)
 * caps a window that stays open but never takes what it asked for. An ERRAND claim
 * (`claimIsBounded`) reserves nothing here: its pid names its ISSUER, not its
 * taker, so it proves nothing about anybody waiting. A new claim may still be
 * written straight over a released record.
