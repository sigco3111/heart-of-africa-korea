// TAKING THE BATCH BACK INTO THE WINDOW THE USER IS SITTING AT (point 395),
// pinned. The mechanism has exactly one job — give the returning user a door back
// into the batch — and two ways to fail, so every case below is written from a
// failure side first:
//
//   TOO EAGER: a stale claim file hands the batch to a window that was closed
//   hours ago; a dead or pid-reused claimant moves it; the owner drops the lock
//   mid-merge or with a delegated agent still building; two windows are both told
//   the batch is coming to them.
//   TOO TIMID: with nobody holding the lock the claim still waits; the owner's own
//   claim (its session id renamed by a compaction) reads as a stranger's and it
//   releases the batch to itself; a claim changes anything at all for a session
//   that does not own the batch, or for a paused one.
//
// And, as everywhere in this family, nothing here may touch the repository's
// .claude/ (batch-singleton finding 3): every state file is derived from the
// caller's lock path.
