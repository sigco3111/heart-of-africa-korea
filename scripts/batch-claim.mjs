// TAKING THE BATCH BACK INTO THE WINDOW THE USER IS SITTING AT (point 395,
// user 28.07.2026) — the IO half. The decision logic is pure in
// scripts/batch-claim-core.mjs; this module only reads/writes the claim file,
// probes the claimant's process and the git state, and calls the ONE atomic
// acquire that ownership is ever gained through. CLI:
//
//   node scripts/batch-claim.mjs --session <id> [--why "<text>"]
//                                     claim the batch — or take it, if it is free
//   node scripts/batch-claim.mjs --status      who holds it, what is pending, how old
//   node scripts/batch-claim.mjs --withdraw --session <id>   never mind
//
// THE SESSION ID is the one thing this command cannot find out for itself: a CLI
// has no hook payload. `scripts/batch-resume-hook.mjs` prints the whole command
// with this window's id already in it when it stands a session down, which is the
// exact moment the returning user reads — so the id is handed over rather than
// looked up.
//
// Claiming is IDEMPOTENT and the same command is also the "next check": run it
// again and it acquires the moment the owner has released. That is deliberate —
// the user says nothing but "I am back", and the session runs one command until
// it reports that it owns the batch.
