// THE TORN STATES A KILL LEAVES BEHIND (point 443) — the filesystem half.
//
// Point 442 made the repair run BEFORE the successor rather than after the
// damage. This is the other direction: what the doctor is able to see at all. A
// session killed mid-action leaves more behind than a half merge — a lock file no
// git process holds, a worktree git no longer knows, a headless browser eating a
// core for the rest of a fortnight, a truncated work order, a lock reserving the
// batch for a process that is gone, a board the phone reader sees standing still.
//
// THE PRINCIPLE (docs/batch-autonomy.md): every critical action is a transaction
// with an idempotent cleanup step, and that step runs at every start BEFORE any
// work — never "the session remembers to".
//
// The DECISIONS are pure in scripts/batch-doctor-core.mjs (`planRemediation`);
// this module gathers the facts and executes the plan. Everything here takes its
// repository root and its `git` runner as a PARAMETER, so the Vitest layer drives
// each state on a throwaway repository rather than on this one
// (scripts/batch-doctor-states.test.mjs).
