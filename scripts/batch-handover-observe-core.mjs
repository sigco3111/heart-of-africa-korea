// Pure core of the END-TO-END HANDOVER OBSERVATION (point 388).
//
// WHY A SEPARATE OBSERVER: every part of the boundary mechanism worked on the
// night of 28.07.2026 and the batch still stood still for five and a half hours,
// because the parts were never asked to work AS A CHAIN. A green unit layer
// cannot prove this one. So the acceptance is a single observed handover, and
// this module decides — from log lines and git facts alone, never from
// inference — which link of that chain fired and which one broke.
//
// The chain, in order:
//   1. CLOSE     the point the handover names is closed in the work order
//   2. TAKE      the boundary is taken and the lock marked handed-over
//   3. SPAWN     the launcher's next tick accepts the handover and spawns
//   4. TAKEOVER  the successor converts the lock to itself
//   5. WORK      the successor's first turn produces a commit
//
// Each link reports pass / pending / broken. "Pending" is the honest answer
// while the chain is simply not that far yet; "broken" is only ever returned
// against POSITIVE evidence that the link failed — for link 3 that evidence is
// the launcher logging `skip: owner alive` after the handover was recorded,
// which is exactly the line that repeated 21 times that night.
