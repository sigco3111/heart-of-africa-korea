// DECLARING WORK THAT IS IN FLIGHT (point 388, fifth live finding 28.07.2026) —
// the decision half, pure and dependency-injected.
//
// WHY: `batch-progress-guard` cannot see work that has been HANDED OUT. On
// 28.07.2026 a session with three delegated agents building and a browser suite
// running tried to end its turn eight times in a row and was blocked every time
// with "DO NOT STOP THE BATCH — continue the NEXT queue item now". It could not:
// the agent pool was at its cap and the next item needed the machine the suite
// was using. The guard's own text names polling as the sanctioned way to wait,
// but a polling session satisfies nothing it checks — so eight replies were
// written that reached nobody. The batch was not idle; the guard had no way to
// know.
//
// THE SHAPE, deliberately the one `prep-guard --prepped` already uses: the
// session DECLARES what it is waiting on, and the guard allows the stop while
// that work is PROVABLY still running. It is emphatically NOT a way to switch the
// block off — that block exists because the batch stood still for five and a half
// hours on the night of 28.07.2026, and an abandoned wait must not become an idle
// night. Three properties keep the two apart:
//
//   1. EVIDENCE, NOT ASSERTION — and RECENCY, never mere existence. A declaration
//      names things a probe can answer, and each answer must be FRESH: a pid whose
//      process is alive AND started when the declaration says (a reused pid is a
//      stranger), a branch whose tip commit is recent, a worktree where git work
//      recently happened, a log still being written to. Existence alone was the
//      one real hole the four-eyes review found — ~94 stale branches in this
//      repository would each have passed forever.
//   2. ALL of it must check out, not some. When one of three agents finishes, the
//      declaration stops holding and the guard blocks again — which is right: the
//      finished agent's work is now the session's next action (merge it), and
//      re-declaring the remaining two is one command. Erring the other way would
//      let a session sleep behind an evidence list it long outgrew.
//   3. IT ENDS WITH THE WORK, not on a clock somebody has to feed (point 434
//      (6b), 30.07.2026). A wait that outlives the work it was declared for is
//      an idle night with paperwork — but the wall clock was the wrong instrument
//      for saying so: on 29.07.2026 the declaration read `live:false, expired`
//      while its agent had been building for 63 minutes and was mid-merge, and
//      nothing refreshes a declaration while the work runs. What ends the wait is
//      the EVIDENCE going quiet: output (a branch, a worktree) stops checking out
//      within `WORK_FRESH_MS` of the last commit, all by itself. Past
//      `IN_FLIGHT_MAX_AGE_MS` the guard blocks exactly as before wherever nothing
//      is producing output — a pid that merely exists, a log that is merely
//      appended to — so the clock still bounds the assertion-shaped evidence it
//      was written for.
//
// Where the two verdicts are close, this file chooses the BLOCK: a wrong block
// costs one command, a wrong allow cost five and a half hours.

 *
 * The launcher's question is not the guard's. The GUARD asks "may a turn end ride
 * on this declaration?", where an aged one must stop counting — that is what
 * `IN_FLIGHT_MAX_AGE_MS` (45 min) is for. The LAUNCHER asks "what was this owner
 * waiting on?", and for that age is a poor disqualifier: a declaration does not
 * become false by growing old, it becomes false when the session went on working
 * after making it. So the launcher gets its own, far wider window.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CONSTANT NO LONGER DOES (point 434, 30.07.2026). It used to feed a
 * VERDICT: `assessOwner` turned a declaration that had stopped moving into
 * `work-stalled` past `WORK_STALL_MS`, gated by a `lastWord` tolerance — and the
 * three constants involved were so hard to satisfy at once that the verdict was
 * unreachable in production while its tests stayed green. All three are gone with
 * the wedge ladder; liveness is now the LEASE, pure arithmetic on the lock, and
 * nothing about a declaration extends ownership any more (a wait that needs longer
 * says so in advance via `extendLease`).
 *
 * WHAT IT STILL DOES, and why it is still four hours: it bounds how long a
 * declaration stays readable AS a declaration, which is what the launcher REPORTS
 * from when it takes an expired lease — "it was waiting on the agent for point N"
 * rather than a bare takeover line. Four hours because a report is cheap and a
 * wrong one is not: past that the declaration has nothing useful left to say. It
 * stays WRITTEN OUT rather than borrowed from another constant (point 433's
 * lesson): it once read `= WEDGED_MS`, and when that dropped from four hours to 45
 * minutes this window would have collapsed with it — silently, for a reason that

 * and replaced — while its worktree had committed four minutes earlier and its
 * branch tip moved one minute before the replacement was spawned. The successor

 *
 * A LOG is the weakest of the four: an agent that works without printing looks
 * exactly like one that died. A PID is stronger but says only that a process

 *       ignored (and named in `ignored`). Every other kind still has to hold —
 *       a dead pid, a stalled branch or a quiet worktree blocks as before.
 *   (6b) MOVING OUTPUT DOES NOT AGE OUT. The declaration used to expire after 45
 *       minutes and was never refreshed while the work ran, so on 29.07.2026 it
 *       read `live:false, expired` while its agent had been building for 63
 *       minutes and was mid-merge. The expiry now only bites where nothing is
 *       producing output — a pid that merely exists, a log that is merely being
