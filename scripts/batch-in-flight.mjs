// DECLARING WORK THAT IS IN FLIGHT (point 388, fifth live finding 28.07.2026) —
// the IO half. The decision logic is pure in scripts/batch-in-flight-core.mjs;
// this module only reads/writes the marker and runs the probes that PROVE the
// declared work is still running. CLI:
//
//   node scripts/batch-in-flight.mjs --waiting-on "<what>" [--pid N]… [--branch REF]…
//                                    [--worktree PATH]… [--log PATH]…
//   node scripts/batch-in-flight.mjs --status   what the Stop hook would decide
//   node scripts/batch-in-flight.mjs --clear    the wait is over
//   node scripts/batch-in-flight.mjs --agent-check [--worktree PATH] [--branch REF]
//                                    [--log PATH]
//                                    may this delegated agent be REPLACED? Exit 0
//                                    yes, exit 1 no. Run it IMMEDIATELY before
//                                    the respawn (point 434 (5)).
//
// Declaring is DELIBERATE and verified up front, exactly like taking a boundary:
// the command refuses unless this is the batch lock's owner and every piece of
// evidence checks out at the moment it is written, so the session learns at the
// declaration rather than at a blocked turn end.
//
// It does NOT hand the batch over and does NOT touch the lock: a waiting session
// is still the working session, and the launcher must keep seeing a live owner.
// The ONLY thing it changes is that `batch-progress-guard` stops demanding work
// the session cannot do while it waits — and it stops the moment the evidence
// stops checking out, or the declaration ages out.

 * cheaper than walking a checkout, and it already respects `.gitignore`, so
 * `node_modules/` and `dist/` never enter. Three flags carry weight:
 *   · `--no-optional-locks` keeps OUR OWN look from becoming the evidence —
 *     without it git may refresh (and rewrite) the index, which is the
 *     contamination point 434 (5b) names. The caller additionally stats the git
 *     metadata BEFORE calling this, so even a git that ignored the flag could not
 *     backdate the other half.
 *   · `--untracked-files=all` is stated rather than assumed, and it is ALL rather
 *     than `normal` for a measured reason (four-eyes review, findings 5 and its
 *     re-check): a global or repo `status.showUntrackedFiles=no` would otherwise

 *     creates `src/newthing/` and then works inside it for twenty minutes would
 *     read `quiet` all over again. `-uall` names the files themselves.
 *   · `--ignore-submodules=all`, because a submodule's own dirtiness is not this
 *     checkout's work and would cost a recursive status.
 *
 * `limit` bounds the stats, not the newest-wins comparison; `git status` sorts by
 * PATH, so a checkout dirtier than the limit can miss the newest file and fall
 * back to the git metadata. That is the safe direction (it can only under-report
