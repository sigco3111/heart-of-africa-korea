// THE LAUNCHER MUST RUN ONCE (point 474, user 03.08.2026) — raced for real.
//
// The daemon's singleton used to be a check-then-publish: read the record, and if
// nothing armed is in it, start ticking. Two starts milliseconds apart both read
// the same empty record, and node's own ~50–100 ms boot makes that window trivial
// to hit — six simultaneous starts left two to five daemons running, in every
// round of a live probe. Worse, `--stop` then killed the one pid the record named,
// wrote `stopped`, and reported `disabled` while a survivor went on ticking and
// re-armed the record at its next publish.
//
// A test that only asserts the new rule back to itself would prove none of that,
// so this one RACES: real processes, spawned in one synchronous burst on a
// throwaway record, each running the real `runDaemon`. Only the tick is injected —
// the race is over the record, and the batch is never touched.
