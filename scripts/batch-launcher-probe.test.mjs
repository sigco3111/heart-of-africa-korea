// THE BOUNDARY COULD NOT BE VERIFIED ON LINUX (point 474, user 03.08.2026).
//
// `probeLauncherState` returned 'unknown' off win32, and `batch-progress-guard`
// reads 'unknown' as NOT armed — so on the container the project moved to, no
// point boundary could ever be taken. The one stop the batch is allowed to make
// was refused outright, and an autonomous run could not hand over at all.
//
// Both paths are pinned here, each from the OTHER host: the Windows probe must
// still be the PowerShell round trip (this suite runs on Linux), and the Linux
// probe must read the daemon's own record and grant 'armed' on evidence only.
// `platform`, `exec` and the record path are injected, so neither claim depends
// on which machine the suite happens to run on.
