// THE LINUX LAUNCHER (point 474, user 03.08.2026) — a self-scheduling daemon.
//
// On Windows the launcher is the Scheduled Task `HoA-Batch-Autostart`, which runs
// `scripts/batch-autostart.mjs` every 15 minutes and survives crashes and reboots.
// The Linux container the project moved to has NO OS scheduler at all — `cron`,
// `crond`, `systemctl` and `at` are absent and PID 1 is `sh` — so there is nothing
// to register the task as. Without a launcher the batch cannot hand over: the
// point boundary is refused while the launcher is not provably armed, which is
// correct (a stop with nothing to restart the batch ENDS it) and left an
// autonomous run on this host unable to end a session at all.
//
// So the trigger is rebuilt in the only place that is always available here: a
// detached node process that ticks on the same interval. ONLY THE TRIGGER. Each
// tick runs `scripts/batch-autostart.mjs` as a child, exactly as the task did, so
// the hard singleton, the claim reservation and the spawn decision are untouched
// — this file can never spawn a session past them, because it never spawns one.
//
// It refuses to run from a git WORKTREE, for the reason `chat-watcher.mjs` does:
// its record would land in a checkout nothing reads, and its tick would run the
// launcher with a throwaway tree as its working directory. On Windows it refuses
// outright and points at the Scheduled Task — a second launcher beside the task
// would be two triggers for one batch.
//
//   node scripts/batch-launcher.mjs --start    start it, detached
//   node scripts/batch-launcher.mjs --stop     stop it
//   node scripts/batch-launcher.mjs --status   what state it is in
//   node scripts/batch-launcher.mjs --daemon   INTERNAL: the loop itself

 * window trivial to hit, and six simultaneous starts left two to five daemons

 * whoever wrote last owns it — every other daemon sees a live foreign pid at its
 * next publish and leaves WITHOUT writing. That converges to exactly one survivor,
 * because after the globally last write no other process writes again.
 *
 * The same read honours a STOP: a stop mark laid down after this daemon came up is
 * an order to it too, whichever pid the record names. Otherwise the loser of a race
 * outlives `--stop` and re-arms the record at its next tick, making the one promise
 * `--stop` exists to give — nothing will restart the batch — false.
