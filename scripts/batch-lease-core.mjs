// THE LEASE AND THE FENCE — pure decision core (layer 1 of
// docs/batch-resilience.md §3). Side-effect free, so the Vitest layer can sweep
// every rule without a filesystem (scripts/batch-lease-core.test.mjs). The I/O
// lives in scripts/batch-singleton.mjs (lock + fence file) and in
// scripts/board-first-guard.mjs (the one PreToolUse chokepoint).
//
// WHY (the night of 29./30.07.2026): work stopped at 21:50 and the state at
// 04:19 was byte-for-byte the same. Every layer could OBSERVE the stall while
// none could ACT, and where authority existed a condition kept it from reaching.
// The answer is not a better observer but a LEASE: ownership of the batch ends by
// arithmetic, at a moment both sides can compute from the same numbers, with no
// probe, no judgement and no condition in between.
//
// FOUR RULES THIS MODULE ENCODES
//
// 1. RENEWAL IS PRE-, NEVER POST-ToolUse. The existing heartbeat fires AFTER a
//    call returns, so a lease renewed by it would have to outlive the longest
//    single call — and this repository legitimately runs 30-40 minute suites and
//    has recorded 87 minutes of silence with work advancing. Renewing BEFORE the
//    long call keeps the window short and the reader side pure arithmetic.
//
// 2. THE FENCE IS NOT IN THE LOCK FILE. `acquire` DELETES the lock on a takeover
//    and a corrupt one reads as null, so a high-water mark kept there would be
//    lost exactly when it matters and a fresh start at fence=1 would re-admit the
//    old owner's writes. It lives in its own never-deleted, monotonic, max-wins
//    file; the lock carries only a COPY of its holder's number, which lets a
//    deleted fence file be re-seeded upward rather than downward.
//
// 3. AN EXPIRED LEASE IS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT (point 556, 08.08.2026).
//    Arithmetic decides when ownership ENDS; it does not decide alone that the
//    batch may be TAKEN. A session obeying the waiting rule sits inside ONE
//    long-blocking call and cannot renew from in there, so its lease runs out
//    precisely while it is most productive — measured at the 63rd minute, against
//    a live pid and declared work that had moved two minutes earlier, both of
//    which the tick had already read and printed. `leaseTakeoverDecision` makes
//    the takeover ask them, and `DECLARED_WAIT_LEASE_MS` is how such a wait says
//    in advance that it will be long. This is NOT the probing rule 1 refuses: the
//    acquire door still compares numbers, and the corroboration lives in the one
//    reader that already holds the signals.
//
// 4. A SESSION IS ONLY EVER FENCED OUT BY ITS OWN RECORD. Staleness is
//    `heldFence < currentFence` for a session that DEMONSTRABLY held a fence.
//    A session that never held one is never blocked — an attended window, a
//    fresh clone, a session that never drove the batch. Being wrong toward
//    "allow" costs a stale board; being wrong toward "deny" costs a block-loop,
//    which this project has already paid ~30 turns for once.

// ONE classifier for both PreToolUse gates (point 473): the board-first deny and
// this chokepoint judge a shell call the same way — per segment, on the command
// HEAD, with quoted text deciding nothing. `expandSegments` also unwraps what
// CARRIES a command (`bash -c "…"`, `eval`, `$( … )`), because at THIS gate the
// safe direction is the conservative one: the old string regexes saw through a
// wrapper by accident, and losing that would let a dispossessed session push
// shared history through any shell (four-eyes review, 30.07.2026).

 * down with its reason: refresh the lease at call START as well as at completion,
 * or let a DECLARED in-flight wait extend it. THE DECLARED WAIT IS CHOSEN, because
 * only it can hold for a call that blocks for HOURS. A renewal — wherever it is
 * written — buys exactly one `LEASE_MS`, so a call that blocks longer than the
 * window ages its own lease to expiry however often the renewal fires; that is the
 * arithmetic that dispossessed a live owner on 08.08.2026 at the 63rd minute of one
 * blocking poll. (The renewal already IS at call start: `board-first-guard.mjs`
 * runs `renewLease` in PreToolUse. Adding a second one at completion would change

 *
 * FOUR HOURS, pinned to `LAUNCHER_WORK_MAX_AGE_MS` in batch-in-flight-core.mjs —
 * the window in which the launcher still treats a declaration as CURRENT. Longer
 * would keep the batch on paperwork the launcher no longer reads; shorter would
 * expire a wait the launcher still believes in. The two are asserted equal in the
 * test suite rather than imported across, because the dependency would run
 * backwards (batch-in-flight-core → batch-singleton → this module).
 *
 * IT IS NOT AN UNCONDITIONAL FOUR HOURS. The spec says the wait extends the lease
 * "for as long as its own evidence keeps advancing", so the extension is recorded
 * on the lock as `declaredWait: { at, until }` and `declaredWaitStale` lets the one

 * THE LAUNCHER'S TAKEOVER VERDICT. PURE, TOTAL, AND THE WHOLE OF POINT 556's
 * FIRST CLAUSE.
 *
 * MEASURED 08.08.2026, 05:45Z: the launcher logged `LEASE EXPIRED: 5551713b…
 * (pid 4048953) has not renewed for 63 min — taking the batch` and spawned a
 * second session while that owner was ALIVE, mid-verification, with its delegated
 * agent's worktree active. The tick HAD both corroborating signals and printed
 * them itself in the same breath — the pid was alive and the declared work had
 * moved two minutes earlier — and took the batch anyway, because the lease branch
 * asked nothing else. Two sessions then shared one repository.
 *
 * So an expired lease alone no longer dispossesses. It is a NECESSARY condition;
 * the takeover additionally requires that a corroborating signal come back
 * NEGATIVE:
 *   - the pid is dead, or its identity cannot be established at all, OR
 *   - the declared work is not advancing (which includes: nothing was declared).
 * With a live pid AND advancing declared work the tick SKIPS and says so, naming
 * the lease age it overrode.
 *
 * WHY NOT "live pid alone": a wedged process breathes. The whole reason the lease
 * exists is that a pid probe cannot tell working from wedged, so the pid may only
 * ever CORROBORATE evidence of work, never stand in for it. And why the pair is
 * safe: an owner that wants this protection must have DECLARED its wait
 * (`batch-in-flight.mjs --waiting-on`), which is the house rule for any wait long
 * enough to matter, and that declaration is only honoured while a probe confirms
 * the work is still moving. A silent owner with nothing declared is dispossessed
 * exactly as before — the recovery this mechanism exists for is untouched.
 *
 * Inputs (all already read by the tick before it reaches this door):
 *   leaseAgeMs      — how long the lease has been out, for the message
 *   pidIdentifiable — could the lock's process be identified at all
 *   pidLive         — that same process exists and is not a reused number
 *   workAdvancing   — `assessOwnerWork(...).advancing`
