// Stop hook (user mandate 22.07.2026): GUARANTEE the batch never idle-stops.
// While open, non-deferred TASKS points remain and .claude/batch-paused is absent,
// this BLOCKS the turn from ending — the assistant must continue the next item (and
// wait for a running validation by AWAITING it inside the turn, never by yielding
// and never by a poll loop: point 592 measured 2857 poll responses in six days,
// 10.9 % of the weighted spend, the longest chain 437 answers for one word).
//
// HARD SINGLETON (24.07.2026, after the e9407cae double-session incident):
//   - It pushes ONLY the session that holds the live batch lock. A non-owner
//     session STANDS DOWN unconditionally (allowed to stop, never conscripted)
//     — even a session with no readable session id. Ownership is only ever
//     gained through the ATOMIC acquire in scripts/batch-singleton.mjs; the
//     old check-then-claim conscription is gone.
//   - ACTIVE PARALLEL-SESSION DETECTOR: each turn-end, the owner checks for a
//     second live top-level session (fresh tool activity by a non-owner sid in
//     THIS repo — subagents never register, so they are never flagged). On
//     detection it blocks with a remediation instruction: verify the repo with
//     scripts/batch-doctor.mjs before any further batch work.
// POINT BOUNDARY (27.07.2026, point 373): ending is no longer always an idle
// stop. When the session has recorded a boundary (scripts/batch-boundary.mjs)
// for a point the WORK ORDER confirms closed, and the OS launcher is really
// ARMED, this guard ALLOWS the stop — the fresh session the launcher brings up
// carries the next point at a fraction of the context cost. A boundary claim for
// a point still open, or with an unarmed launcher, blocks exactly as before.
// TAKING it (28.07.2026, point 388) is the other half, and the half that was
// missing: permission to stop and the ACT of handing over are different things.
// A session that closed a point and recorded NO marker is now BLOCKED with the
// one command that takes the boundary, and the stop this guard allows RELEASES
// the batch to the launcher (markHandover) — the night of 28.07.2026 the turn
// ended, the process lived on, the lock stayed held and the launcher skipped 21
// ticks in a row. The handover is written HERE and nowhere else: only this branch
// has established a fresh session-bound marker, a verifiably closed point and an
// armed launcher. A crash, a wedge or an ordinary turn end never reaches it.
// WAITING IS NOT IDLING (28.07.2026, point 388, fifth live finding): this guard
// could not see work it had HANDED OUT. With three delegated agents building and
// a browser suite running, it blocked eight turn ends in a row demanding the next
// queue item — which the session could not start (pool at its cap, the suite on
// the machine the next item needed), so eight replies reached nobody. A session
// may now DECLARE what it waits on (scripts/batch-in-flight.mjs) and the stop is
// allowed while a probe still confirms that work is running. It is not a way off
// the block: the declaration expires, its evidence is re-proved every turn end,
// and the lock stays HELD, so nothing is handed over to anyone.
// THE USER TAKES THE BATCH BACK (28.07.2026, point 395): the night belongs to
// fresh sessions, but the way BACK was missing. A window the user returns to
// records a CLAIM (scripts/batch-claim.mjs); this guard is where the owner SEES
// it, and — at the first CLEAN turn end, never mid-merge and never with a
// delegated agent or a verification still running — RELEASES the lock and says so
// in its own transcript. It is the boundary's sibling: there the batch goes to
// the launcher, here it goes to the window the user is sitting at, which is why
// the claim is honoured ahead of a valid boundary.
// Format-safe: a TASKS.md whose checkboxes no longer parse blocks with a warning
// instead of silently reading "complete". Fail-open on any error.
