// SessionStart hook: auto-resume the TASKS.md batch (user mandate 2026-07-14 —
// the batch must complete autonomously; no session may sit idle waiting for a
// "continue"). Prints the resume instruction only while TASKS.md still has
// unticked points AND this session actually WINS the batch ownership:
//   - a user PAUSE marker (.claude/batch-paused) suppresses auto-resume entirely
//     until an explicit go;
//   - ownership goes through the ATOMIC acquire in scripts/batch-singleton.mjs
//     (hard singleton, 24.07.2026): a lock held by a LIVE owner — liveness by
//     heartbeat AND a real OS pid check, so a mid-long-tool-call session reads
//     alive — can never be taken over, and two racing starters resolve to
//     exactly one winner. The loser gets an explicit STAND-DOWN instruction.
//   - a session spawned by the OS launcher converts the launcher's
//     'pending-spawn' lock to itself (pid-bound + one-shot authorization) —
//     it never overrides a live lock (the old unconditional claim was the
//     e9407cae incident's second hole).
// It also records this TOP-LEVEL session id for the parallel-session detector
// (subagents never fire SessionStart, so they can never be flagged).
