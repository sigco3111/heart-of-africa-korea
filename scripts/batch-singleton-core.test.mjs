// Hard-singleton sweep (scripts/batch-singleton.mjs): the five mandated
// scenarios of the 24.07.2026 user order, pinned as regression witnesses —
//   (1) two racing starters against the atomic acquire → exactly one wins
//       (REAL child processes, real 'wx'/mkdir semantics);
//   (2) a live owner with a fresh heartbeat → a starter (incl. the post-reboot
//       autostart path) refuses;
//   (3) a genuinely dead owner (stale heartbeat + dead pid) → takeover allowed;
//   (4) the EXACT incident: reboot night, a live re-claimed session with a
//       fresh heartbeat → the autostart must NOT spawn; and its true root
//       cause: a stale heartbeat with a LIVE pid (mid-long-tool-call) is ALIVE;
//   (5) a non-owner session at the batch-progress-guard → stands down.
