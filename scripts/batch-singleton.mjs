// HARD batch singleton (user mandate 24.07.2026, after the e9407cae incident:
// two live sessions drove the batch and committed to main concurrently).
// This module is the ONE authority on "who may drive the batch":
//
//   1. A single OWNER LOCK (.claude/batch-lock.json) held as a LEASE: session id,
//      the owning claude process's OS PID and start time, a heartbeat timestamp,
//      and `leaseUntil` — the moment ownership ENDS unless it is renewed. The pid
//      makes liveness REAL: a session mid-40-minute tool call writes no
//      heartbeat, but its process is provably alive — the old claimedAt-age-only
//      check declared exactly such a session dead and double-spawned (the
//      incident's root cause). The LEASE answers the opposite question, the one
//      the night of 29./30.07.2026 lost seven hours to: a process that is alive
//      but no longer working keeps nothing. Renewal is PreToolUse and expiry is
//      pure arithmetic — there is no probe, no verdict and no condition at the
//      acquire door (docs/batch-resilience.md §3, layer 1;
//      scripts/batch-lease-core.mjs).
//   1a. A FENCE (.claude/batch-fence.json), monotonic and never deleted: every
//      acquisition takes a number, so a session that was dispossessed can be told
//      apart from the one that holds the batch now. It cannot live in the lock
//      file — `acquire` deletes that — and it is enforced at ONE PreToolUse
//      chokepoint (scripts/board-first-guard.mjs) for the four paths that have no
//      guard of their own: the work-order tick, `git merge`/`push`, the board
//      publish and `dashboard-state.json`.
//   2. ATOMIC acquisition (test-and-set, never check-then-set): first claim via
//      exclusive file create ('wx'); takeover of a dead lock via a reap MUTEX
//      directory (mkdirSync is atomic) so two racing starters can never both
//      win, and a racer can never clobber a freshly re-claimed live lock.
//   3. STAND-DOWN: every guard/hook asks this module before pushing a session
//      to work. A session that does not hold the live lock is treated as
//      paused — it refuses to drive the batch even if it exists by mistake.
//   4. An ACTIVE parallel-session DETECTOR: every top-level session start and
//      every tool call is recorded per session id; a second top-level session
//      with fresh tool activity in THIS repo is flagged, the owner is told to
//      verify repo consistency (scripts/batch-doctor.mjs), and the autostart
//      launcher kills a rogue spawn of its own making.
//
// Legacy compatibility: the lock file keeps the old `sessionId`/`claimedAt`
// fields (claimedAt doubles as the heartbeat), so a not-yet-updated reader
// still sees a fresh lock as "held". Pure decision logic is dependency-injected
// and Vitest-covered in scripts/batch-singleton-core.test.mjs.

// silently swallowed failures would age a LIVE session toward "provably dead".
// The one caller that must not be taken down by the throw — the boundary branch

/**
 * Assess whether the owner recorded in `lock` is alive. Conservative: only a
 * PROVABLY dead owner frees the lock. Inputs:
 *   lock  — parsed lock file ({ sessionId, claimedAt, pid?, pidStartedAt?, kind? })
 *   now   — epoch ms
 *   bootTime — epoch ms this machine booted (claude never survives a reboot)
 *   probe — { exists: boolean, startedAt: number|null } for lock.pid
 *           (pass null when no pid is recorded)
 * Returns { alive, reason }.
 *
 * ONE VERDICT, NOT THREE (point 434, docs/batch-resilience.md §6). This function
 * used to answer "is the owner alive" three ways at once: the pid probe, a
 * declared-work stall bound (`WORK_STALL_*`) and a heartbeat-age valve
 * (`WEDGED_MS`), each with its own threshold and its own review. All three tried
 * to INFER from silence what only the owner can state, and on the night of
 * 29./30.07.2026 all three read a seven-hour standstill as "owner alive". They
 * are gone. What replaces them is the LEASE: the owner says how long it means to
 * keep the batch by writing `leaseUntil` BEFORE each call, and this function only
 * compares that number to the clock. No probing, no evidence, no judgement — a
 * lease that ran out is over even if the process is still breathing (it keeps
 * running; it merely stops owning the batch, and learns that at its next hook).
 *
 * A LOCK WITHOUT `leaseUntil` IS NOT A SPECIAL CASE and needs no migration: it
 * reads as an implicit lease of `claimedAt + LEASE_MS` (`leaseUntilOf`), which is
 * the same shape the demolished age valve had. The live owner across this change
 * keeps working and writes a real lease at its next tool call.
 *
 * HANDOVER (point 388, revised by point 612): a lock the owner itself marked
 * handed-over reads NOT alive, even while its process still runs, and it does so
 * AT ONCE. That is the one place where a live pid does not mean a live owner —
 * and it is not a heuristic like the age window that caused the e9407cae
 * incident, but the owner's own statement, written only after the Stop hook
 * confirmed a fresh session-bound marker, a verifiably closed point and an armed
 * launcher. The two conditions that used to qualify it — `claimedAt <=
 * handedOverAt` and a 15-minute wait for a live process — are GONE, because on
 * 10.08.2026 they cost 35 minutes of idle batch: any later write of the lock
 * stamps `claimedAt` past the mark without deleting it, and the handover then
 * silently stopped counting while the flag still sat in the file. A handover is
 * withdrawn by DELETING it (`withdrawHandover`, and `heartbeat` where
 * `withdrawalIsCausal` says the work really came after) — an explicit act.
 *
 * THE VERDICT ITSELF IS NOT HERE. Everything above — the handover, the fresh
 * heartbeat, the boot check, the lease and the idle window — is one decision, and
 * it lives in `ownershipVerdict` (scripts/batch-ownership-core.mjs) so that point
 * 612's idle rule and point 517's lease extension cannot become two competing
 * arithmetics on the same number. This function reads the files and the pid probe
 * and asks that one; only the pid branches below, which ARE probe semantics, stay.
