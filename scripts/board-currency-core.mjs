// Pure core of the BOARD-CURRENCY chain (point 400). Side-effect free, so the
// Vitest layer can sweep every rule without a filesystem, a git remote or a
// network (scripts/board-currency-core.test.mjs).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Three cards were missing from the published board for up to
// 25 minutes while the user was reading it, and the flagship mode is worse than
// that: the headless successor session (`claude -p`, spawned by the OS launcher)
// had no way to publish, so on 28.07.2026 it edited the board and recorded a
// deferral. In that mode the board could not be updated AT ALL.
//
// The LEGACY (claude.ai artifact, retired 29.07.2026) mirror survives here in
// exactly two places — `publishedHash` and `artifactToolSeen` — so that an old
// record still counts and never re-blocks a board that was live. Nothing writes
// them any more; the transport below is what every session runs.
//
// The chain this module serves, in the order it was built:
//   A  the DUE MARK — the open-point set is hashed after every tool call and a
//      CHANGE sets `publishDue` in dashboard-state.json (persisted, so a session
//      that dies between the change and the publish hands the mark on).
//   B  the DENY — board-first-guard refuses the first state-changing call while
//      a publish is due, but only where a publish is actually POSSIBLE.
//   D  the TRANSPORT — the board is pushed to a branch of this repository and
//      read back over plain HTTPS, which a headless session can do and a
//      verification can check against the PAGE rather than a state record.
//   E  the WATCHDOG — the launcher fetches the live board and says so when it
//      is behind, which is the only layer that still speaks when the session
//      itself is wedged.
