// Pure decision core of the BOARD-FIRST gate (board-first-guard.mjs is the thin
// fail-open I/O wrapper). Side-effect free, so the Vitest layer can sweep every
// rule without a filesystem (scripts/board-first-core.test.mjs).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (user 27.07.2026, retrospective §3.32): every board enforcer —
// dashboard-guard, dashboard-integrity-guard, dashboard-conciseness-guard,
// dashboard-card-topic-guard and the focus review — is a STOP hook. They all
// fire when the turn ENDS, so they guarantee the board is honest by the time the
// work is over and say NOTHING about the hour in between. That hour is exactly
// when the user reads the board: the now-card still read "Pausiert —
// Wochenkontingent erschöpft" while a review agent and a branch cleanup were
// already running, and the user had to point it out twice. The gap is
// structural, not a lapse of discipline, so it gets a mechanism.
//
// THE RULE: the FIRST state-changing tool call of a turn is DENIED while the
// board does not yet describe the work that is starting. "Describes it" is not
// judged from prose — the gate reads two already-recorded facts:
//   (i)  a `focus set|confirm` stamped AFTER this turn's `turnStartedAt`, and
//   (ii) the published board content equal to the repo file's content
//        (the invariant dashboard-publish already maintains).
//
// THE ESCAPE PATH IS PART OF THE DESIGN. A gate that can trap the session is
// worse than the staleness it fixes (a block-loop cost ~30 turns on point 278),
// so the gate:
//   - never denies a READ of any kind,
//   - never denies the very commands that satisfy it (focus.mjs,
//     dashboard-publish.mjs, dashboard-guard.mjs, an edit of the board file),
//   - denies AT MOST ONCE per turn — after it has fired it stands down, so a
//     session that ignores it can still work; the Stop chain still catches the
//     end state,
//   - and is fail-OPEN in the wrapper: any internal error allows the call.
//
// THE THIRD CONDITION (point 400, delta B): a publish is DUE. The open-point set
// changed since the board was last published, so the reader is looking at a
// board that is missing work — the 25-minute window of 28.07.2026. The mark is
// written by the PostToolUse heartbeat (delta A) and read here.
//
// It may only ESCALATE to a deny where a publish is actually POSSIBLE. Denying
// a session a publish it cannot perform would spin it against a gate it can
// never satisfy, and a blocked turn produces nothing. `publishCapability`
// (board-currency-core) is that question; since the delta-D transport is a
// SCRIPT, the answer is yes for every session, headless included.

// ═══ Point 470 — "nothing is running" is a CLAIM TO STOP ═════════════════════
//
// The board carried "Gerade keine laufende Arbeit" while three things were in
// flight, and the user reported it four times in one evening. The asymmetry that
// makes it enforceable: "nothing is running" is a statement about the FUTURE of
// the turn. It is true only if the session stops now — so the next
// state-changing call is the proof it was false, and that call is the one this
// gate refuses.
//
// WHAT STAYS OPEN, so the claim can never trap a session:
//   - reads, and everything `classifyTool` already treats as escape (the board
//     commands themselves, an edit of the board file);
//   - the whole CLOSING SET (`handoverSurvivesCall`) — the calls that END a
//     session rather than carry it on: `batch-boundary.mjs`, the focus stamp, the
//     board publish, the mechanism-review record, the work-order tick. That set
//     is the case the claim exists for, so blocking it would be exactly wrong.
// Everything else — a commit, a test run, an agent, a source edit — is the
// session working on, and it is denied while the claim stands.
//
// THIS DENY DOES NOT STAND DOWN after firing once, unlike the focus/publish
// conditions above it. Those can be blocked on facts a session may be unable to
// change; this one is a sentence the session itself wrote, its remedy is one
// command, and that command is never blocked. A stand-down here would leave the
// lie on the board for the rest of the turn — which is the whole defect.
//
// A REMEDY MUST REACH THE STATE THE SESSION IS IN (point 544, 07.08.2026). The
// deny named two ways out, and a session finishing its CLOSING DUTIES could take
// neither: `now <N>` needs an open point that already has a queue card, and
// `none` rewrites only the reason, never the title, so the claim and the deny
// stood. A finished retrospective refresh could not be committed, filing the
// point about it was itself blocked, and the session had to raise the next queue
// point early just to get a card it could stand behind — which is working AROUND
// the guard, the one thing this chain cannot afford. The third card says that
// state truthfully, `claimsNoCurrentWork` is false under it, and the deny names
// it as the third way out.
