// THE BOARD TRANSPORT (point 400, delta D) — the board goes live from a script,
// so EVERY session can publish it, and comes back over plain HTTPS, so a check
// can read the PAGE rather than a record of an attempt.
//
//   node scripts/board-publish.mjs           # push the board live
//   node scripts/board-publish.mjs --check   # fetch the live page and judge it
//   node scripts/board-publish.mjs --url     # print the URLs and exit
//
// WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A TOOL. The board used to be publishable only through a
// tool the headless successor session (`claude -p`, spawned by the OS launcher)
// does not have. On 28.07.2026 that session edited the board and recorded a
// deferral: in the flagship mode — user away, batch resurrected by the scheduler
// — the board could not be updated AT ALL. A commit and a push it has.
//
// WHERE IT LANDS, AND WHY NOT ON `main`.
//   content : an ORPHAN branch `board` of this repository, ONE commit that is
//             force-updated on every publish. Nothing accumulates — the history
//             is a single object, replaced. `main` is untouched, so a board
//             publish is not a source change: it triggers no CI (which watches
//             `main` and `feat/**`) and no Pages deploy (which rebuilds the game
//             AND every frozen version tag — minutes of runner time for a status
//             card). A publish every few minutes is therefore free.
//   viewer  : public/board/index.html, deployed with the site by the workflow
//             that already runs. It is a SOURCE file, committed once; it fetches
//             the content branch at load. So the reader gets one stable URL
//             while the content behind it moves without a deploy.
//
// THE FLOOR OF "CURRENT". The push itself lands in seconds, but
// raw.githubusercontent serves with `cache-control: max-age=300`. `--check`
// therefore fetches with a cache-buster AND tolerates `LIVE_GRACE_MS` of
// disagreement (board-currency-core): a page that differs while the publish is
// still settling is reported as 'settling', not as an alarm. Only a page that is
// still behind past the grace — or one that cannot be read at all — is a fault.
//
// FAIL LOUD, NOT SILENT. A failed publish is PERSISTED (`publishFailed`), which
// is what the watchdog in scripts/batch-autostart.mjs reports when the session
// itself is wedged and no Stop hook will ever run again.
