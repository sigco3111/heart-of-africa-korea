// Pure core of the DERIVED QUEUE (point 400, delta C). Side-effect free, so the
// Vitest layer can sweep every rule without a filesystem
// (scripts/board-queue-core.test.mjs).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The board's footer has been DERIVED since point 371
// (`refreshFooter` + `parseTasks`), and it went stale on 28.07.2026 for one
// reason only: the board HTML was hand-edited past that pipeline. The queue
// section had never been derived at all — it was maintained by hand, card by
// card, against a work order that changes several times a day. Three cards were
// missing from the published board for up to 25 minutes.
//
// So the queue becomes a PROJECTION, not a document:
//
//     TASKS.md (which points are open, and in which order)  +  board-queue.json
//     (title, body and estimate per point)
//                              ↓  buildQueueSection
//                        the Warteschlange HTML
//
// THE ORDER IS THE WORK ORDER'S, AND IS STORED NOWHERE (point 608, 10.08.2026).
// Until then the data file carried its own `order` list, and the two drifted: on
// 10.08.2026 the work order was re-sequenced TWICE — four points pushed behind
// 602, five throughput levers pulled to the head — the board was rebuilt and
// republished both times, and it kept showing the old sequence, because the
// generator read that stored list. The user found it before any check did; the
// board is the one surface he steers the batch by. One fact, one home: the
// sequence of open points in TASKS.md IS the queue order, and the data file
// keeps only what is genuinely its own — title, body, estimate.
//
// TWO WRITERS ON ONE HTML IS THE TRAP. A generator that re-adds a card for a
// point already promoted to the now-section trips the double-listing invariant
// (4b) of dashboard-guard-core, and the guard is right to block: the reader
// would see one point as simultaneously in progress and waiting. The generator
// therefore takes an EXCLUDE set — every point the other sections already
// claim — and the caller derives it from the live document rather than from
// memory.
//
// A POINT WITH NO PROSE YET GETS A STUB, NEVER NOTHING. Silence would drop the
// point off the board entirely, which is the exact failure this point exists to
// end. The stub names the point (headline read from the work order) and says
// plainly that it has no description yet. Because `auditDashboard` demands a
// "~<n> h" estimate on every queue card, the stub carries an EXPLICIT
// unestimated marker that the audit accepts by name — otherwise the stub would
// block `--synced` and create the very block loop this design exists to
// prevent.
