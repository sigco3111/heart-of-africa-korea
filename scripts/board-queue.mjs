//   node scripts/board-queue.mjs --check            # report what would change
//   node scripts/board-queue.mjs set <N> "<text>"   # write one point's prose

//
// GERMAN TEXT GOES IN ON STDIN (point 439, the rule of point 410): `--text-stdin`
// fills whichever field it follows, so an umlaut never passes through a Windows
// shell. Until it existed, a session that tried to pipe prose in stored the
// literal string `--text-stdin` as the card body, and six cards showed the user a
// command-line flag where their explanation belonged.
//
// WHY IT HAD TO EXIST (four-eyes review, NEW-1). `board-publish.mjs` refuses a
// board that does not show every open point, and the case that triggers that
// refusal is precisely a freshly appended work-order point with no card
// anywhere. `board.mjs queue <N>` cannot serve it: that command MOVES a
// current-work card back to the queue and throws when there is none. So without
// this CLI the only way out was hand-editing the board HTML — the very thing
// that broke the board three times on 28.07.2026.
//
// TWO WRITERS ON ONE HTML IS THE TRAP the core's header warns about, so the
// generator takes an EXCLUDE set derived from the LIVE document: every point the
// now-cards and "Von dir zu klären" already claim. A card re-added for a point
// already promoted would trip the double-listing invariant (4b) and block the
// turn that published it.
