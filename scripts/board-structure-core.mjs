// Is the board still STRUCTURALLY intact? (28.07.2026 — three breakages in one
// evening, the third one visible on the user's phone.)
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is not a rule anyone has to remember: the board is
// one HTML file that gets edited. Every edit that reaches for the section around
// a card — "cut from the heading to the next <h2>, reorder, paste back" — can
// move a closing tag, and the browser then nests the following cards inside the
// wrong container. That happened three times on 28.07.2026: the now-cards landed
// in the next section, an orphan `<details class="sect"><summary><h2>` was left
// behind with no content, and the "Von dir zu klären" heading lost its wrapper.
//
// The existing consistency audit DID catch each one — but only at
// `dashboard-guard --synced`, which runs AFTER the publish. So a broken board
// reached the reader and was repaired afterwards. This check therefore runs in
// `board-publish.mjs`, BEFORE the bytes leave: a malformed board can then not be
// published at all, whatever produced it and whoever forgot which editing
// technique is safe.
//
// It deliberately checks STRUCTURE only — nothing about content, freshness or
// wording, which the consistency audit already owns. Pure and total: it never
// throws, so a publish can never be blocked by this module misbehaving.
//
// The one import is the board's OWN names for its two unnumbered state cards
// (point 544): which KIND a current-work card is cannot be judged from markup
// alone, and spelling those titles a second time here is how the writer and the
// gate would drift apart. board-core does not import this module, so the
// direction cannot become a cycle.
