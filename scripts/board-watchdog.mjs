// THE BOARD WATCHDOG (point 400, delta E) — one tick of "is the live board
// still telling the truth", run as its OWN process by scripts/batch-autostart.mjs.
//
//   node scripts/board-watchdog.mjs [--last-key <k>] [--streak <n>] [--quiet]
//
// It fetches the live page, compares the open-point fingerprint it carries with
// the work order, and sends the ntfy alert when the page is behind or unreadable
// — or when a publish has been due or has failed for longer than a launcher
// tick, which is the case where the session is wedged and no Stop hook will ever
// run again. It prints ONE json line for its caller and always exits 0: a board
// check may never be a reason for the launcher to fail.
//
// A FETCH THAT FAILS IS NOT A BOARD THAT IS GONE (point 562). Every probe is
// RETRIED at once before it counts as anything; a failed currency probe is
// corroborated against the OTHER transport (the viewer host the reader opens);
// and only consecutive full failures of both count toward the escalation, whose
// last rung pauses the batch. On 08.08.2026 a flickering fetch — interleaved with
// successful probes of the same URL, while `--check` reported CURRENT — climbed
// that ladder and stopped every point in the queue. The streak lives with the
// caller (`--streak`, returned in the json line), exactly like `--last-key`.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE PROCESS, and not a block inside the launcher. On this platform
// a `process.exit()` after any `fetch` tears undici's socket down mid-close and
// ABORTS the process (`Assertion failed: !(handle->flags & UV_HANDLE_CLOSING)`,
// exit 127). The launcher exits that way at fifteen different points, and its
// real job is resurrecting a dead batch — so it must not hold a fetch at all.
// A child process is also containment no try/catch can match: whatever happens
// in here, the resurrection above it is untouched.
