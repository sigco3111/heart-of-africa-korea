// GERMAN TEXT GOES IN ON STDIN (point 410). Wherever a "<text>" stands above,
// `--text-stdin` may take its place and the text is read from stdin as UTF-8:
//
//   node scripts/board.mjs status 410 --text-stdin <<'EOF'
//   Stand 12:40: Die Umlaute überleben den Weg aufs Board jetzt.
//   EOF
//
// The argument form still works and is fine for ASCII; a Windows shell mangles
// umlauts on the way, which is why every session used to transliterate by hand.
// `--none` takes it too — that gap card is written at every session boundary, so
// it was the last place a German text still reached the board as an argument:
//
//   node scripts/board.mjs done 434 --none --text-stdin <<'EOF'
//   Der Punkt ist abgeschlossen. Ich übergebe an eine frische Sitzung …
//   EOF
//
// A BLANK LINE IN THE PIPED TEXT BECOMES A PARAGRAPH (point 439). The
// conciseness guard blocks a long body squeezed into one <p>, and until now the
// only way to split one was hand-editing the board HTML.
//
// Every editing command publishes the live page itself, so the loop is exactly:
// (1) an editing command, (2) `attest`.
