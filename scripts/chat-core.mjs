// THE CHAT CHANNEL'S DECIDING HALF — pure, no I/O, no clock of its own.
//
// The board is READ from a phone; this is the way back. The transport is ntfy
// (already a dependency of scripts/notify.mjs): one INBOX topic carries phone →
// agent, one OUTBOX topic carries agent → phone.
//
// WHY THE CRYPTO IS THE POINT AND NOT A LATER HARDENING. The board page is
// PUBLIC — anything embedded in it is public. A topic name in that HTML would be
// an open port into a session that runs with permissions pre-granted and a
// GitHub token on disk; the realistic worst case is command execution on the
// user's machine. So:
//   - the topics are DERIVED from a shared secret (SHA-256), never written into
//     any tracked file and never into the published page. The page asks the user
//     for the secret once and keeps it in localStorage; the machine keeps it in
//     the git-ignored .claude/chat-secret.
//   - every message carries an HMAC-SHA256 over its canonical (id, ts, text).
//     Anything unsigned, mis-signed, stale or already seen is DROPPED here.
// The signature is authentication, NOT authorisation: a verified message is
// still untrusted INPUT. It may never authorise an outward-facing or
// irreversible step (tag, publish, force-push, delete) — see docs/batch-autonomy.md.
//
// WEBCRYPTO ONLY, ON PURPOSE. The browser half of this protocol lives as a
// literal inside public/board/index.html (a deployed page cannot import a Node
// module), so both halves are written against the same `crypto.subtle` API and
// the SAME derivation strings. scripts/chat-core.test.mjs extracts the page's
// block, runs it in Node and asserts byte-identical topics and signatures — a
// drift between the two would silently split the channel in half.

 * never seen — it verified, spooled, and reached the spawn prompt AS THE USER'S
 * WORDS. Nobody needs the secret for that. The ntfy.sh operator sees both topics
 * and every plaintext envelope; so does a TLS-inspecting proxy on the phone's
 * network, because the page polls both.
 *
 * ATTRIBUTION IS THE ONE PROPERTY THE HMAC EXISTS FOR, so the direction is bound
 * INTO the signed string. It is deliberately NOT carried on the wire: the
