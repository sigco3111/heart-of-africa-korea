//   node scripts/chat-inbox.mjs            # poll, spool, print one json line
//   node scripts/chat-inbox.mjs --pending  # print the spool without polling
//   node scripts/chat-inbox.mjs --ack <n>  # consume the oldest n spooled messages
//
// It fetches the INBOX topic over ntfy's JSON poll endpoint, drops everything
// unsigned / mis-signed / stale / already seen (scripts/chat-core.mjs decides,
// purely), writes what survives into the spool DIRECTORY .claude/chat-spool/ —
// one file per message, atomically (scripts/chat-spool.mjs explains why it is a
// directory and not the stage-1 .jsonl) — and advances the cursor in
// .claude/chat-state.json. A stage-1 .jsonl left on disk is migrated into that
// directory on the first tick and archived, never dropped.
//
// FAIL-SOFT, ALWAYS EXIT 0. Its caller is scripts/batch-autostart.mjs, whose job
// is resurrecting a dead batch: a chat poll may never be the reason that fails.
// Every error path prints `{ ok: false, reason }` and exits 0.
//
// IT RUNS AS ITS OWN PROCESS for the same reason the board watchdog does: on
// this platform a `process.exit()` after any `fetch` tears undici's socket down
// mid-close and ABORTS the process (exit 127, `Assertion failed: !(handle->flags
// & UV_HANDLE_CLOSING)`), and the launcher exits that way at fifteen points.
//
// THE CURSOR IS NOT THE DEDUPE. It only narrows the next poll; the ledger of
// seen ids in the state file is what guarantees once-only delivery. Delete the
// state file and the whole retention window is re-read — and nothing is spooled
// twice, because the ledger travels with the spool (see `seededLedger`). The
// ledger counts CONSUMED messages too: a message the session has already read is
// exactly the one a re-poll must not hand over a second time.
