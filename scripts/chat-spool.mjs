// THE SPOOL AS A DIRECTORY — one file per message, and why it is not one file.
//
// Stage 1 appended every accepted message to `.claude/chat-spool.jsonl`. That
// shape works while the ONLY consumer is the launcher, which reads the whole
// file once a quarter of an hour. It does not survive stage 2: the per-tool-call
// delivery reads the spool several times a second and must REMOVE what it has
// just shown, or the same message is injected into the context on every tool
// call — a token leak at exactly the rate the delivery rule exists to prevent.
//
// Removing one line from a shared append-only file means read → slice → rewrite,
// which races the poller's append and is not atomic on this platform anyway:
// `.claude/boundary.log` recorded a real `EPERM … rename` from a scanner holding
// the target file open (see scripts/atomic-write.mjs), and a per-tool-call reader
// is precisely the scanner-shaped load that produced it.
//
// So a message is a FILE. The poller creates `.claude/chat-spool/<id>.json`
// atomically (tmp + rename, with the retry ladder); the consumer RENAMES it into
// `.claude/chat-spool/consumed/` before it shows it. Rename is the operation the
// filesystem gives us for free: exactly one caller can move a given file, so two
// consumers can never deliver the same message, and a crash between the rename
// and the delivery loses at most that one message instead of duplicating it
// forever. Creation and consumption never touch the same bytes.
//
// THE CONSUMED FILES ARE NOT RUBBISH. The replay ledger is seeded FROM the spool
// (see `seededLedger` in scripts/chat-inbox.mjs): a message that vanished with no
// trace could be re-accepted by the next poll for as long as ntfy keeps it — 12
// hours. Consumed messages therefore stay readable and are pruned only well past
// that window (`CONSUMED_RETENTION_MS`).
