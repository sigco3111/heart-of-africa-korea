// THE MESSAGE WAKES THE MACHINE — stage 3 of the board chat, deciding half.
// PURE: no I/O, no network, no clock of its own. The wrapper is
// scripts/chat-watcher.mjs.
//
// WHERE THIS SITS. Stage 1 (point 405) built the channel; stage 2 (point 406)
// delivers a message at the next tool call of a RUNNING session. What was left
// was the idle machine: with nothing running, a message waited for the next
// launcher tick — up to fifteen minutes. A long-lived local process subscribed
// to the inbox topic removes that wait, at an idle cost of one open connection:
// no model, no tokens.
//
// THE ONE THING IT MUST NOT BECOME IS A SECOND BATCH SESSION. The first design
// said "use the same lock as the launcher", which is self-defeating in both
// directions:
//   - taking the OWNER lock makes the woken session the batch owner, and
//     `progressGuardDecision` then conscripts it into working the whole queue.
//     A one-line question would pay for a batch orientation and would not stop
//     at the answer.
//   - taking NO lock makes it exactly the parallel top-level session
//     `classifyParallel` raises an alert about, and that alert blocks the real
//     owner's turn end.
// The compatible channel already exists: the BOUNDED claim of point 395. The
// watcher files one for the responder's lifetime — a sanctioned reason for the
// launcher to stand down at its tick — and it is released on every exit path.
//
// WHAT THE CLAIM DOES **NOT** BUY, stated because the first draft of this file
// promised it (four-eyes review 29.07.2026, finding 3). `classifyParallel`'s
// `exclude` list keys on a SESSION ID, and the claim's is synthetic
// (`chat-responder-<uuid>`) — it can never equal the responder's real claude
// session id, which nothing knows before that session starts. So the responder
// is NOT excluded from the parallel-session detector. In the ordinary run that
// costs nothing, because the launcher bails at the honoured claim BEFORE it
// detects, and the wake gate refuses to spawn beside a live owner in the first
// place. It bites only in the narrow window where the watcher dies while its
// responder is still answering: the claim stops being honoured, a launcher tick
// may then spawn a real owner, and that owner's guard WILL raise a
// parallel-session alert naming the responder. Bounded (the responder is capped
// at ten minutes) and visible (the alert is the point), but real — and the honest
// statement of it is worth more than a comment claiming an exclusion that the
// code cannot deliver.
//
// THE CLAIM NAMES THE WATCHER'S OWN PROCESS, and that is the deliberate part.
// `assessClaim` honours a claim only while the recorded pid exists AND started
// when the claim says it did, so a watcher that is KILLED — SIGKILL, a reboot,
// a crash no handler survives — releases the claim by ceasing to exist. There
// is no path on which a dead watcher can leave the batch reserved; the 30-minute
// expiry is only the second bound. Naming the RESPONDER's pid instead was tried
// on paper and is wrong: the responder's own SessionStart hook resolves a claim
// that names its own claude process as ITS OWN claim (`resolveOwnership` matches
// by process), and would then acquire the owner lock — precisely the outcome
// this module exists to prevent.

 * ones this responder was actually HANDED are ever candidates, never whatever
 * else arrived meanwhile.
 *
 * Without an ack at all the duplicate would not be a risk but a certainty: the

 * — every message a responder had already answered.

 * THE ACK ASKS FOR EVIDENCE, NOT FOR AN EXIT CODE (four-eyes review 29.07.2026,
 * finding 1b — the worst defect of the first cut). `exitCode === 0` is evidence
 * of nothing: a responder that reads its prompt, stands down and ends its turn
 * cleanly exits 0, and acking on that took the user's INSTRUCTION off the spool
 * with nobody having answered it. It then reached no session at all — a silent
 * loss, worse than the fifteen-minute wait the watcher exists to remove.
 *
 * `actedAt` is the moment a reply was actually SENT: `recordReplyReceipt` in
 * scripts/chat-reply.mjs writes it only after the transport ACCEPTED the post.
 * It must postdate the spawn, or it is some earlier session's answer. NOT
 * ACKING is the safe direction throughout — the message stays pending and the
 * next session is handed it, which costs a duplicate at worst. The exit code is
