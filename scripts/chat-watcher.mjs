// THE MESSAGE WAKES THE MACHINE — stage 3 of the board chat, the IO half.
// The whole decision logic is pure in scripts/chat-watcher-core.mjs.
//
//   node scripts/chat-watcher.mjs             # subscribe and wake a responder
//   node scripts/chat-watcher.mjs --dry-run   # subscribe, DECIDE, spawn nothing
//   node scripts/chat-watcher.mjs --status    # is a watcher running, and what does it hold
//   node scripts/chat-watcher.mjs --stop      # stop the running watcher
//
// WHAT IT COSTS WHILE NOTHING HAPPENS: one open HTTPS connection. No model, no
// tokens, no timer that wakes anything. That is the whole reason it is a
// subscription and not a poll — and the second reason is ntfy's free-tier rate
// limit, which a process polling every few seconds walks straight into.
//
// THE DRY RUN IS NOT A TOY. The live path can only ever be observed from a
// machine with NO session running, which is precisely the machine nobody is
// sitting at. `--dry-run` opens the real subscription, verifies every arriving
// envelope through the same scripts/chat-core.mjs path, prints one JSON line per
// event saying what it WOULD do and why — and spawns nothing, claims nothing,
// spools nothing. It is how the subscription itself gets proven from a session
// that is holding the batch lock.
//
// IT REFUSES TO RUN FROM A WORKTREE. A watcher started inside a git worktree
// would write its claim and its pidfile into that worktree's `.claude/`, where
// the launcher and the guards never look, and would spawn a responder whose cwd
// is a throwaway checkout. Same treatment scripts/retro-refresh.mjs got after it
// rewrote a document as empty from one: loud and free, rather than silently
// wrong. The dry run is exempt — it changes nothing, and being able to watch the
// channel from a worktree is exactly what it is for.
