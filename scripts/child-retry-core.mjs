// LAYER 5 — RETRY A CHILD, NOT AN OUTAGE (point 434 part 3), the decision half:
// pure, dependency-injected, no I/O. The I/O lives in scripts/child-retry.mjs.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. On the night of 29./30.07.2026 two delegated agents died on
// ONE upstream 500 within the same minutes. A naive "the child died, spawn it
// again" would have bought four more deaths into the same outage and burned the
// night's remaining tokens on nothing. The opposite failure is just as real: a
// single transient death today ends a point that was three commits from done,
// and nobody notices until morning. So the rule is neither "always retry" nor
// "never retry" — it is:
//
//   1. TRANSIENCE IS AN ALLOWLIST, never a guess. HTTP 5xx/429/529,
//      ECONNRESET/ETIMEDOUT and the harness's own "API error" death are
//      transient. EVERYTHING else — a red gate, a guard block, an escalated
//      brief, an unrecognised message — is NOT, and the default is no retry.
//      A death whose text merely CONTAINS a number must never read as a 500:
//      the non-transient markers are matched FIRST and win.
//   2. THE SAME SIGNATURE ACROSS TWO CHILDREN IN ONE WINDOW IS AN OUTAGE.
//      Not bad luck, not a retryable accident — pause the batch and report it.
//      This is the clause that would have prevented that night.
//   3. NEVER REPEAT WORK THAT LANDED. A child that reported a step complete is
//      never retried (its output is on the branch and belongs to the merge, not
//      to a second build), and a child that COMMITTED since its spawn is
//      re-prompted to CONTINUE rather than to repeat.
//   4. THE SAME BRANCH AND THE SAME BRIEF REVISION, or it is not a retry. A
//      changed brief is a new spawn and goes through the ordinary door.
//   5. BOUNDED. At most two retries per point, rising backoff, and a token cap
//      per point so one stubborn item cannot eat a night's budget.
//
// Where two verdicts are close this file chooses the CHEAPER MISTAKE: not
// retrying costs one deliberate re-spawn in the morning; retrying into an
// outage costs the night.
