// Pure decision logic of the closing-completeness guard (closing-guard.mjs is
// the thin fail-open I/O wrapper + CLI). Kept side-effect-free so the Vitest
// layer can sweep every rule without fs/git (scripts/closing-guard-core.test.mjs).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (user mandate 24.07.2026): the v0.2 release TAGGED the demo
// after running only the LARGE regression — the dead-code / stale-doc /
// stale-comment cleanup + the .md audit (the very steps that distinguish a
// CLOSING from a plain regression, §7.2 / Maximum-QA Phase 8) were SKIPPED,
// because the closing steps were tracked by fallible MEMORY, not enforced. This
// guard makes a version release IMPOSSIBLE while any closing step is unchecked:
// a PreToolUse hook on the shell tools blocks the tag/poc creation-or-push (and
// --tags) unless EVERY step below is recorded done FOR THE EXACT COMMIT tagged.
//
// The SECOND release act the checklist gates is the CLAIM that a closing is
// finished — in this repo's machine-readable form, the `[ ]`→`[x]` TICK of a
// work-order point whose own spec delivers a closing (the point-224 shape). The
// v0.2 miss was exactly that: the point was ticked while the cleanup steps had
// never run. So the same checklist decides the tick, on the work-order EDIT.
//
// The enforcement is PRE-tag (a PreToolUse deny), not a post-hoc Stop block, so
// the bad state can never reach the remote. Fail-open is the WRAPPER's job; this
// core must never throw on partial input (a guard bug must not trap the session).

 * The canonical closing checklist — every step a full closing cycle must
 * complete before a version tag (§7.2 + Maximum-QA Phase 8 + CLAUDE.md §9).
