// "A blocked turn is ACKNOWLEDGED, not repeated" — the pure half of the
// doubled-message fix (user 28.07.2026, verbatim example: the 19:18 and 19:19
// replies were the same text).
//
// THE MECHANISM that produced it: the closing reply is composed FIRST, the Stop
// chain runs AFTERWARDS. A guard blocks, the demanded action is performed, and
// the turn has to end with a message once more — so the user reads the same
// answer twice. Three cases in one afternoon, and `timestamp-guard`'s own
// wording was the worst offender: it asked in so many words for the closing
// reply to be written a second time, which guarantees the duplicate rather than
// merely risking it.
//
// TWO THINGS FOLLOW, and neither of them weakens a guard:
//  - the ORDER: the routine turn-end duties are done BEFORE the closing reply
//    is composed (CLAUDE.md §7.2, `guard-preflight.mjs --for answer`);
//  - the WORDING: a guard that blocks anyway demands the SAME thing it always
//    demanded, but names the deliverable for what it is — one short line, not a
//    re-run of the answer. `shortAckDemand()` is that sentence, shared by every
//    guard that has to ask for a closing line, so there is one wording to keep
//    right instead of one per guard.
//
// `findRepeatDemands()` is the ratchet: it reads a guard's SOURCE (comments
// stripped, so the history above may be told in prose) and reports any surviving
// instruction to write the answer over again. A future guard that reintroduces
// the phrasing fails the pure test rather than the user's inbox.
