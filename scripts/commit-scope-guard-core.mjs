// repository on 15.07.2026 inside a commit about first-person walk feel, and
// `music/` followed on 21.07.2026 inside a commit about the calf guard. Neither
// file had anything to do with its commit: both were lying in the working tree
// and a commit that staged EVERYTHING took them along. Removing them is a
// one-off; the class of accident is not, so the rule gets a mechanism rather
// than a reminder (the project's standing "enforce, don't remind" principle).
//
// The core is pure and Vitest-covered; `commit-scope-guard.mjs` only collects
// the staged paths and sizes and prints the verdict.

// THE MESSAGE CHECK (user 28.07.2026): a rescue commit must not raise an alarm.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS: when a delegated agent is killed mid-build its uncommitted
// work is committed and pushed AT ONCE — durability first, nothing may stay
// only local. But the branch push starts CI and CI fails on the half-finished
// state, which back then mailed the repository owner. That happened on
// `feat/300-gait-matches-speed`: the rescue push went red, the follow-up commit
// went green, and in between the user got a failure mail for a state nobody
// claimed was finished. `main` was green throughout — the noise is entirely
// branch-side.
//
// The fix is a commit-message convention, not a workflow change: a rescue
// commit carries `[skip ci]` in its SUBJECT, which GitHub Actions honours for
// push events. The commit still exists, still pushes, still survives the
// session — only the run (and with it every announcement of its red) is skipped
// for a state that is explicitly not a claim of completeness.
//
// BOTH HALVES OR NEITHER. An unmarked rescue alerts on a state nobody claims is
// done; a bare `[skip ci]` on ordinary work silently skips a real gate. So the
// trailer demands the marker and the marker demands the trailer.

/** The machine-readable declaration: a `Rescue:` trailer with a reason after
 *  it. A bare `Rescue:` says nothing, so it does not count as a declaration. */
