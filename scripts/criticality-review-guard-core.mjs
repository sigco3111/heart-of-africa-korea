// Pure decision core of the CRITICALITY four-eyes gate (work-order point 298).
//
// WHY IT EXISTS: the standing rule is that a change is triaged by difficulty ×
// CRITICALITY before it is built, and that a HIGH item — a guard, the batch
// singleton, save/load, anything load-bearing or hard to reverse — gets a
// model-diverse review of the plan and of the result. Carried by intention, that
// rule was applied where somebody happened to remember it. Worse (measured
// 30.07.2026): THE REVIEW CAN OUTLIVE ITS AUTHOR. A delegated agent spawned its
// Fable-5 reviewer in the background and then stopped; the review landed in the
// parent session minutes later with verdict `do-not-merge` and two blockers, one
// of which would have reddened main's unit gate the moment the branch merged.
// The branch LOOKED reviewed and was not.
//
// So the gate is not "was a review recorded" but "were its FINDINGS acted on":
//   - a HIGH-criticality point that gets TICKED needs a recorded review by a
//     DIFFERENT model, against a commit that is genuinely in this history;
//   - a `do-not-merge` or `merge-with-fixes` verdict does NOT satisfy it. Only a
//     later `merge` record, for a LATER commit (a descendant of the refused one),
//     says the findings were answered. That is deliberately stricter than the
//     MECHANISM gate beside it (mechanism-review-core.mjs), where
//     `merge-with-fixes` clears: there the fixes are in the diff a human still
//     reads, here the point is being declared finished.
//
// The two gates SHARE one ledger (.claude/mechanism-reviews.jsonl) and one
// record command (scripts/mechanism-review.mjs), so a guard change that closes a
// high point is recorded once, with `--point <N>` naming the point it settles.
//
// Side-effect free — the git work, the state file and the block belong to
// scripts/criticality-review-guard.mjs (fail-open). Pinned by
// criticality-review-guard-core.test.mjs.

 *     Criticality: medium."), so it is not anchored to the line start;
 *   - `medium` is accepted and normalised to `med` — both spellings are in use;
 *   - a QUOTED occurrence is skipped. Point 298's own spec quotes the convention
 *     it defines ("Criticality: low|med|high"), and reading that as a tag would
 *     have the gate judge points by a sentence ABOUT the tag.
 * The LAST surviving match wins: the tag is written at the end of a spec, while
 * an earlier mention is prose.
 *
 * Anything else — no tag, an unknown word — answers `{ level: null }`, which
 * leaves the point ungated. That is the fail-open direction on purpose: a
 * malformed tag must not block a turn, and the points that predate the
 * convention (the overwhelming majority) carry none at all.
