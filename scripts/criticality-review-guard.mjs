// Stop hook (work-order point 298): a HIGH-criticality point does not get
// ticked without a second model's recorded, ANSWERED review.
//
// The rule — triage difficulty × criticality, and put a different pair of eyes
// on the HIGH work — was carried by intention and applied where somebody
// remembered it. The gate beside this one (mechanism-review-guard) covers a
// change by its FILE PATH; this one covers it by its DECLARED CRITICALITY, which
// is the half no path rule can see: save/load, the batch singleton and the
// deadline are must-work systems that live nowhere near scripts/.
//
// Decision logic: criticality-review-guard-core.mjs (pure, Vitest-covered). This
// wrapper only gathers git output and one state file, and is fail-OPEN — an
// internal error never traps the session.
//
// WHERE IT STANDS DOWN, and why each one:
//   - .claude/batch-paused exists                    (the batch is not running)
//   - another live session owns the batch lock       (subagents must not be judged)
//   - the checkout is not on `main`                  TASKS.md is main-only and the
//     tick happens on main (CLAUDE.md §6). On a feature branch the work order is
//     whatever main last said, so a branch that merges main in would otherwise
//     re-report main's own (already cleared) ticks as its own.
//
// GRANDFATHERING: the baseline is per branch and self-arms at the fork point on
// its first run, exactly as mechanism-review-guard does. The points ticked before
// this gate existed owe nothing.
//
// How the gate clears:
//   node scripts/mechanism-review.mjs --record <sha> --point <N> --model <name> \
//       --verdict <merge|merge-with-fixes|do-not-merge> --evidence "<one line>" \
//       --mode <review|blind-parallel>
// CLI:
//   node scripts/criticality-review-guard.mjs --status
