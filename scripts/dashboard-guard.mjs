// Stop hook (user mandate 21.07.2026, hardened 22.07.2026): GUARANTEE the batch
// dashboard stays current — reminders alone repeatedly failed, so this BLOCKS a
// turn from ending while the dashboard is out of sync with the real batch state.
// The decision logic lives in dashboard-guard-core.mjs (pure, Vitest-covered);
// this wrapper only gathers the inputs and is fail-OPEN: any internal error →
// allow, so a guard bug never traps the session.
//
// Enforced invariants (see the core for the full comments):
//   (1) registered   (2) fresh vs HEAD          (3) no ticked point in the queue
//   (4) every open point visible                (5) focus declared (focus.mjs)
//   (6) now-card title point == declared focus  (7) reconcile after a user prompt
//   (8) re-affirm after ~30 min of work         (8b) full-consistency audit (313)
//   (9) repo file == published content
//
// The companion flow after every dashboard edit:
//   node scripts/board-publish.mjs              # push the board to the live page
//   node scripts/dashboard-guard.mjs --synced <dashboard.html path>
// --synced VALIDATES FIRST (point 313): while auditDashboard() reports
// violations it records NOTHING and exits 1 — the board cannot be attested
// inconsistent. On a clean pass it records the reviewed HEAD, refreshes the
// integrity snapshots, advances the doneSeen baseline (newly ticked points must
// have shown their Erledigt card to get here), and — when the now-card matches
// the declared focus — doubles as the focus confirmation. Emergency bypass for
// a genuinely unfixable finding: --waive-audit "<reason>" waives exactly the
// CURRENT file hash (any further edit re-arms the audit); the waiver is logged
// in dashboard-state.json.
