// Pure decision logic of the dashboard-INTEGRITY Stop-hook guard
// (dashboard-integrity-guard.mjs is the thin fail-open I/O wrapper). Kept
// side-effect-free (no fs/git — node:crypto only, deterministic) so the Vitest
// layer can sweep every predicate (scripts/dashboard-integrity-guard-core.test.mjs).
//
// Built 22.07.2026 after a session in which the dashboard was WRONG four times
// and each error was only fixed on the user's prompt. The existing guards check
// the now-card against the DECLARED focus; nothing checked either against the
// ACTUAL work, or a queue card against its (possibly re-specced) TASKS point.
// Three new machine-checkable invariants, each conservative (allow on
// ambiguity — better a missed nag than a false block):
//
//   (A) NOW-CARD ~ ACTUAL WORK — the now-card/declared-focus point must be
//       supported by the git evidence: working-tree edits attributable (via the
//       file paths each TASKS spec names) to the now/focus point, or recent
//       commit subjects naming it. "Card says 215 while every edit is 210 work"
//       blocks; any supporting evidence, or thin/ambiguous evidence, allows.
//   (B) NO STALE QUEUE CARD — a Warteschlange card whose point is closed ([x])
//       in TASKS.md, or does not exist there at all, blocks (the closed half
//       overlaps dashboard-guard invariant 3 on purpose — this guard also runs
//       standalone; the nonexistent half is new).
//   (C) CARD ~ SPEC DRIFT (heuristic) — at --synced time a snapshot records,
//       per queue card, a hash of the card text AND of its TASKS spec block.
//       If a later turn changes the spec while the card text is unchanged, the
//       card is flagged possibly-stale. This is a reminder-to-reconcile, NOT a
//       correctness proof: re-running --synced after an honest review (card
//       still accurate) refreshes the snapshot and clears the flag.
//
// Fail-open is shared: the wrapper allows on any I/O error, and every function
// here is total (never throws, degrades to "no finding") on partial input.
