// The text the UserPromptSubmit hook injects into EVERY user prompt — the most
// expensive text in this project, so it lives in a pure module the Vitest layer
// can hold to its shape and its size (point 436).
//
// WHY IT SHRANK, from 2153 characters to under 900. It used to restate the
// board's whole structure contract: four sections, their order, the card shape,
// the `open`-attribute ban, the queue card's header meta. Every one of those is
// now REFUSED by a gate before the board can be published — `structureViolations`
// (board-structure-core) on the sections, their order and the wrappers,
// `auto-open` and `queue-meta` in dashboard-guard-core. Reminding of a rule a
// gate already refuses to break is the pattern this project replaced everywhere
// else, and here it was billed on every single prompt.
//
// WHAT STAYS is exactly what no mechanism can check — a judgement about MEANING:
// whether a piece of information sits in the section it belongs to, whether the
// board looks right on a phone in portrait, and that a structure change is
// PROPOSED as a card rather than made. Plus the commands, because a duty with no
// command is a duty that gets postponed. Dropping any of these would be worse
// than the repetition, which is why dashboard-reminder-core.test.mjs pins both
// halves: an enforced claim may not reappear, the rest may not disappear.
