// Pure decision core for the document-budget guard (user 26.07.2026).
//
// WHY: the two documents that are read most often had quietly grown until
// reading them was itself a cost. CLAUDE.md — loaded at EVERY session start —
// stood at 17 700 words, four fifths of it evidence chains needed only at a
// closing. The work order had reached 13 000 lines, three quarters of it
// finished points, plus a preamble of ordering notes about points closed weeks
// earlier. Both were cut; neither cut holds by itself, because the growth was
// never a decision — it was the sum of honest single additions.
//
// So the sizes get budgets, in the shape that already worked for the beginner's
// guide: a measured ceiling, a stated reason, and the demand that a budget is
// raised only for content that genuinely belongs, never to make room for a
// longer telling of something already there.
//
// WHAT IS AND IS NOT BUDGETED, because the distinction is the whole design:
//   - Whole file, where every line is prose that accretes: CLAUDE.md, design.md.
//   - PREAMBLE ONLY for the work order: its POINTS are legitimate growth (a
//     queue may be long), while its framing sections are where rules pile up.
//     A line budget on the whole file would punish appending work.
//   - docs/acceptance-criteria-detail.md, which point 555 turned from a two-
//     criterion offcut into the home of all 32. It is read on demand like the
//     evidence chains beside it, so its size costs nothing per turn — but it is
//     now THE FILE THAT GROWS INSTEAD, and an uncapped destination is how a cut
//     comes back: the §7.1 text would simply accrete over there and be dragged
//     into every context that opens a criterion. A budget on it keeps the growth
//     a decision.
//   - Not budgeted: docs/acceptance-evidence.md, docs/design-reference.md and
//     the archive (reference material, read on demand — their size costs
//     nothing per turn), and the retrospective (its job is to hold every
//     problem class; capping it would trade the wrong thing away).

    // (point 339, user 25.07.2026): the key stops opening a state popup and
    // starts producing a whole bug report, so the bullet must name the

    // at the top of the state, and — the part no reader can infer — that
    // the picture is the 3-D scene ALONE, since every label and the HUD are
    // HTML. Without that last sentence a missing label in the image reads
    // as evidence of a bug that is not there. Not a longer telling of
    // something already here: the old bullet described a different feature.
    // RAISED by 43 measured words for point 369: an orphaned juvenile mourns
    // before it plays again, and the trigger is DEATH rather than distance —
    // a genuinely new §19.8 decision, which is what this mechanism prices in.
    // The margin left over is unchanged, so the next sentence pays its own way.
    // RAISED by the 189 measured words (3 lines) of the two water rules of
    // point 316: §11.2 gains the guarantee that a blocked boundary SLIDES
    // rather than pins, and §11.3 that a river reaches the sea as slack
    // water. Both are genuinely new decisions — the old text said what
    // blocks and how fast the current runs, never what happens when the two
    // meet, and the answer is the difference between a swim and a softlock.
    // The tunable-value entry behind the slack ramp went to
    // docs/design-reference.md §21.2, which is unbudgeted.
    // RAISED by the 215 measured words of the new §19.17 (point 264): animals
    // of one species fight each other, on the researched species only. A whole
    // §19 behaviour the document did not describe in any form — the disposition,
    // the converge/chase paths, the clash and its lethal-vs-ritual resolution —
    // not a longer telling of anything already here; the §19.8 dramas beside it
    // are all predator-, family- or water-driven and say nothing about rivals of
    // one kind. It was compressed twice before this raise (from 245 to 215 words
    // and from 7 lines to 6, so the LINE ceiling is untouched), and the research
    // record it summarises lives in docs/intraspecies-combat-1890.md while its
    // eleven tunable values went to docs/design-reference.md §21.2 — both
    // unbudgeted, so only the design decision itself is priced here. The user
    // APPROVED this raise on 09.08.2026 — the board asked him to confirm it or
    // have 215 words found elsewhere, and he chose to confirm. That yes is what
    // the rule above demands for a raise; it is settled, not open.
    // RAISED by the 102 measured words of the keyboard capture (work-order 601):
    // §17.8's third rule said the browser's Ctrl combinations stay the browser's,
    // and that decision is what closes the player's tab while he walks — Ctrl is
    // the hold key and W walks forward. Its replacement is a genuinely new
    // decision and states three things the document did not carry in any form:
    // what a page may prevent is prevented, the three reserved chords are held by
    // a keyboard lock bound to fullscreen + pointer lock, and where that lock is
    // unavailable the hold key is REBINDABLE. The LINE ceiling is untouched (the
    // rule is one bullet, as before), the §17.5 mention was cut to a
    // parenthesis, and the mechanics went to the code and to
    // docs/acceptance-criteria-detail.md, so only the decision is priced here.
