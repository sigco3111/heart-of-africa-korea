// Pure decision core of the findings-durability check.
//
// A finding that lives only in the chat dies with the session. On 29.07.2026
// one evening produced three defects — the project hooks that cannot fire
// outside the repo root, a bundling scheme covering 53 of 91 open points, and
// point 409 repeating within 24 hours — and every one of them survived only
// because the USER asked twice whether they were being kept. That is not a
// discipline problem: a session that does not own the batch lock cannot write
// TASKS.md at all, so the state most likely to produce a finding is exactly
// the one with no durable path anything checks.
//
// Hence two conditions, one per session state:
//   1. A turn that INVESTIGATED and recorded nothing blocks. Investigation is
//      COUNTED from the turn's tool calls, never inferred from meaning — a
//      guard that guesses what a turn was "about" would be unfalsifiable.
//   2. A session that OWNS the batch and still has entries in the carrier
//      blocks. Memory is the transport for a locked-out session, never the
//      resting place; without this the carrier becomes what
//      pending-queue-work-29-07.md already was — a note nothing drains.
//
// Side-effect free; the wrapper (findings-guard.mjs) reads the tree and is
// fail-open, so a bug in here can never trap a session.

/** Investigative calls needed before a recordless turn is judged.
 *
 *  Calibrated against the whole transcript corpus, NOT against an impression.
 *  First measured by the second model on 29.07.2026 (2709 turns, 43 sessions,
 *  on the Windows host): counting every shell call as investigation blocked
 *  10.6 % of all turns and 73 % of those blocks were build/verify turns, not
 *  analysis. With shell calls classified read-only-or-not (below) the rate fell
 *  to roughly a twentieth of the turns, and the samples there were genuinely
 *  analysis. A guard that fires on an ordinary turn trains the reader to skip
 *  it, which is the argument guard-health-core.mjs makes about enforcers in
 *  general.
 *
 *  THE CLAIM IS NOW REPLAYABLE (08.08.2026). A measurement that lives in a
 *  review message is a memory, so the cases it cites are cut into
 *  `findings-fixtures.json` — real turns, one family per case, replayed by
 *  `findings-fixtures.test.mjs` on every unit run. Re-measured there on the
 *  Linux corpus: at the cut recorded in that file (809 turns, 56 sessions) this
 *  rule blocks 1.1 % of turns and the shell-counts-as-looking rule 5.6 %, while
 *  the 377 answer-only turns block under neither. The direction reproduces on a
 *  corpus the first measurement never saw; the absolute rates do not transfer
 *  between corpora, and the corpus keeps growing, so the figures are the CUT's,
 *  not constants. The block rate is an UPPER bound: a historical turn has no
 *  in-flight file mtime, so a declared wait the live guard would honour on that
 *  half counts as a block in the replay.
 *  Re-measure with: node scripts/findings-fixtures.mjs --measure */
