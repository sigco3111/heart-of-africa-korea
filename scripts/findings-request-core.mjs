// Pure layer of the carrier's REQUEST kind (point 462).
//
// WHY A SECOND KIND RATHER THAN A SECOND CARRIER. A window the user is talking
// to is regularly NOT the batch owner: on 30.07.2026 one held a pending claim
// for an hour while the user settled three decisions, and TASKS.md is main-only
// and batch-owned, so nothing could be enqueued — the specs lived in a
// scratchpad outside the repository and would have died with the window. The
// findings carrier already IS the lock-free atomic append by a non-owner, it
// already has a drain protocol, and its guard is already wired. Two carriers
// would be two drain disciplines to forget one of.
//
// THE DEPOSIT IS THE FINISHED SPEC, not a note that the user wants something:
// only the depositing window holds the conversation the spec comes from, and the
// owner will never see it. So a request carries the TASKS-ready final state, the
// user's own words with their date, the bounds he named, and what the ruling
// implies for the documents — leaving the owner the mechanical half it alone may
// do: append it verbatim and number it.
//
// Side-effect free and total: every function takes text and returns data, a
// malformed entry is REPORTED rather than thrown on, and nothing here can block
// a turn (findings-guard.mjs is fail-open and owns that direction).
