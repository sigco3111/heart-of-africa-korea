// ADDITIVE allowlist top-up for the dev container's egress firewall.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (incident 04.08.2026): the only tool the session had for "one
// more host has to be reachable" was `sudo /usr/local/bin/init-firewall.sh` —
// the container's full rebuild. That script FLUSHES every chain and destroys the
// ipset at the top while the default policies stay DROP (a flush clears rules,
// never policies), so from its first line until its last the container is
// sealed. The Bash tool's two-minute default timeout killed one such run at
// exit 143 and the session died with ConnectionRefused: no network, no way to
// ask for help, nothing left to run.
//
// This script is the answer to the common case. It NEVER flushes, NEVER
// destroys, NEVER touches a policy or a chain — it only adds addresses to the
// existing `allowed-domains` ipset. Every failure mode therefore leaves the
// firewall exactly as it was: an add that fails adds nothing. It cannot seal the
// container, which is the whole reason it is a separate script rather than a
// flag on the rebuild.
//
//   node scripts/firewall-allow.mjs                    # top up what this project needs
//   node scripts/firewall-allow.mjs cdn.example.com
//   node scripts/firewall-allow.mjs 1.2.3.4 10.0.0.0/8
//   node scripts/firewall-allow.mjs storage.googleapis.com --net24
//   node scripts/firewall-allow.mjs api.example.com --dry-run
//
// `--net24` adds the /24 around each resolved address, for the rotating CDN
// pools where the address resolved now is not the one the download lands on
// minutes later — the trigger of the incident: `cdn.playwright.dev` redirects to
// Chrome-for-Testing archives on Google's storage pool, the boot-time allowlist
// held one address out of that pool, the browser install failed, and the session
// reached for the rebuild because no smaller tool existed.
//
// With NO argument it tops up exactly that set — the Playwright CDN and its
// Chrome-for-Testing storage, Hugging Face, npm and the API host itself — and
// then VERIFIES each one is actually reachable, so the answer to "did that help?"
// comes from the network rather than from an exit code.
//
// A top-up is NOT persistent: the ipset lives in the kernel and a container
// restart re-runs init-firewall.sh from scratch. A host that is needed on every
// boot belongs in the domain list of `.devcontainer/init-firewall.sh` — this
// script says so when it succeeds, so a one-off does not quietly become the
// permanent arrangement.
