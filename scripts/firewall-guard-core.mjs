// Pure decision core of the firewall guard (firewall-guard.mjs is the thin
// fail-open PreToolUse wrapper).
//
// THE RULE: no live firewall command is typed by hand. On 04.08.2026 the session
// ran `sudo /usr/local/bin/init-firewall.sh` through the Bash tool. That script
// flushes every chain and destroys the ipset at the top while the default
// policies stay DROP — a flush clears RULES, never POLICIES — so the container
// is sealed from its first line to its last. The Bash tool's two-minute default
// timeout killed it at exit 143, mid-flush. No network, no way to ask for help,
// session dead with ConnectionRefused. The rule is not "be careful with
// iptables"; it is that the one command with that failure mode must be
// unreachable by hand, and the two safe routes must be the only ones open.
//
// WHAT IT DENIES: a command that MUTATES the packet filter — an iptables flush,
// policy, chain or rule change, an ipset add/destroy/flush, an nft/ufw change,
// a route or link change, and init-firewall.sh in execution position.
//
// WHAT IT LETS THROUGH, deliberately:
//   * every READ: `iptables -L -n`, `iptables -S`, `iptables-save`, `ipset list`,
//     `nft list ruleset`, `ip route`. Reading is how a firewall problem is
//     diagnosed at all, and no read has ever sealed anything.
//   * every MENTION: a quoted command inside an echo, a commit message, a grep
//     pattern, a `cat` of the container script. Blocking prose would make this
//     guard unusable in the very session that has to write about the incident.
//   * the two SANCTIONED routes: `node scripts/firewall-allow.mjs` (additive
//     top-up, cannot seal) and `node scripts/firewall-rebuild.mjs` (detached,
//     watchdogged). A guard that offered no way through would only teach the
//     session to phrase the same command differently.
//
// WHERE THE LINE IS. It catches plausible REPHRASINGS — `eval '…'`, `su -c`,
// an `xargs` pipe, `nsenter`, `env -`, a subshell/brace group/function — because
// those are what someone reaches for when the obvious form is denied and they
// still believe they need it. It does NOT chase deliberate evasion: a
// substituted tool name (`sudo $(which iptables)`), a variable holding it, a
// `node -e`/`python3 -c` one-liner, a renamed copy. The only actor this guard
// protects is the session typing the command, and chasing those buys false
// positives on ordinary substitution and interpreter use rather than safety.
//
// FAIL DIRECTION: allow. Every shape it cannot parse falls through to no
// finding, and the wrapper is fail-open on top of that. A missed mutation costs
// one risky command; a false deny costs the session the ability to work.
