// scripts/pre-push-gate.mjs sitting in the tree while no hooks path pointed at
// it, so it could never run once. Neither was found by a check; both were found
// by chance.
//
// The cheapest reliable signal for "can it fire at all" is WIRING: an enforcer
// script that appears in no hook command and in no git hooks path is dead by
// construction, whatever its contents. The second is a TESTED pure core, the
// project's schema for making a guard's own logic trustworthy.
//
// Dormancy is allowed — but as a RECORDED verdict, never as silence. That is
// the same rule the corpus audit applies to a retired memory: a reader who
// knows the script must see that it was parked on purpose.
//
// Side-effect free; the wrapper (guard-health-guard.mjs) reads the tree and is
// fail-open.

// wired RELATIVELY (`node scripts/x.mjs`), so a session whose cwd is not the
// repo root lost the WHOLE chain to a non-blocking `Cannot find module` —
// silently, because a hook error produces no notice. Measured over 46
// transcripts (06.–29.07.2026): one session 99 failures against 11 hits, three
// more between 44/51 and 12/81. The failing cwds were the memory directory,
// `hoa/local`, `~/.claude` and a second checkout. THE PROOF OF CAUSE: the two
// user-scope hooks are wired absolutely and never failed once.
//
// It is worse than a missing hook, because a guard signals a block through
// stdout JSON with EXIT 0 — a crashed guard exits 1, which the harness reads as
// "no objection". The veto is not delayed, it is LOST: a crashed closing-guard
// would have let a version tag through.
//
// The check is deliberately structural, not textual: it judges the hook COMMANDS
// out of `.claude/settings.json`, one row each, never the concatenated wiring
// blob. `scripts/git-hooks/pre-push` and `commit-msg` are relative ON PURPOSE
// (git always runs a hook from the repo root), so a blob-wide grep would accuse
// two correct files. They are excluded by construction: they are not in this
