// Pure core of the guard preflight (point 365 D, user 26.07.2026).
//
// WHY: a guard that blocks costs a whole turn at full context — the
// render-verify loop on point 278 cost about thirty such turns for one process
// mistake. Asking the guards BEFORE the action they govern costs one cheap
// process run instead.
//
// This module only orchestrates and formats. The inputs come from each guard
// WRAPPER's exported gather step and the verdict from its pure core (wired in
// scripts/guard-preflight.mjs): the gathering is where a reimplementation would
// drift and hand back a false "clean", so the preflight never writes its own.
//
// ADVISORY BY DESIGN: state changes between the preflight and the action, so the
// guard itself stays the authority. A clean preflight is a good sign, not a pass.
//
// ONE DENY THIS REPORT DOES NOT MODEL (point 434, 30.07.2026): the PreToolUse
// FENCE chokepoint in `board-first-guard.mjs`. It refuses merge/push, the TASKS.md
// tick and archive move, the board publish and `dashboard-state.json` to a session
// whose batch fence has been superseded — one that lost the batch while it was
// silent. This report can therefore read "clean" where that gate denies. It is not
// wired in because the answer is not a guard verdict but an ownership FACT, and its
// remedy is not "satisfy the gate" but `node scripts/batch-claim.mjs` or stop
// driving the batch — which the deny text says in full. Wire it here if a session
// is ever seen looping against it.
