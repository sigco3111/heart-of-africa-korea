// Pure decision core of the guide-brevity guard.
//
// docs/analysis_de/vibe-coding-anleitung.md is a SHORT beginner's guide: per
// pitfall one or two sentences of risk, then the prompt that solves it. It is
// not a project logbook — the detailed experience belongs in
// retrospektive-zusammenarbeit.md. Left to prose alone the guide drifts back
// into a chronicle, because every new lesson feels worth its own paragraph.
//
// So the brevity is MEASURED, not intended: a total budget, a per-pitfall
// budget, a demand that every pitfall ends in an actionable prompt, and a
// detector for the project-specific markers that signal a war story leaking in
// (dates, point numbers, repo paths, the project's own tech and nouns).
//
// Side-effect free. The wrapper (guide-brevity-guard.mjs) reads the file and is
// fail-open; guide-brevity-core.test.mjs pins this logic AND audits the real
// document on every unit-test run, so the regression itself is the enforcement.

// The budget caps NARRATIVE growth — a pitfall swelling into a case study — not
// the NUMBER of transferable tips: the guide's whole value is how many usable
// prompts it carries. So it is raised only by the measured size of genuinely new
// tips, each still bound by the per-entry budgets below, and never to make room
// for a longer telling of something already there. Raised on 26.07.2026 by the
// two tips on scoping the most expensive check and on splitting the task list
// from its archive (+18 lines, +163 words), and again on 26.07.2026 by the tip on
// budgeting the documents that are read at every start (+10 lines, +92 words),
// and again on 26.07.2026 by the tip on the QUOTA being the real limit — deliver
// each helper's brief instead of letting it search, and start a fresh context per
// task (+10 lines, +101 words). Raised again on 27.07.2026 by three tips: isolation is a
// property of the environment rather than of an instruction (in the concurrency meta-rule,
// whose prompt gains the clause), the pitfall of asserting an intended state in the
// present tense (+13 lines, +146 words for those two together), and the four-eyes
// counter-check on a MECHANISM needing its own enforcement — what the record has to name,
// and that the author's own "looks fine" is not one (+5 lines, +46 words).
// Raised again on 30.07.2026 by ONE genuinely new tip — what reaches the reader is not what
// was meant: a fallback substituted in silence, and an internal shorthand spoken to him — plus
// one clause on the existing "read at every start" tip, that the dearest text is the one
// carried in EVERY request, especially where it repeats what a gate already refuses
// (+9 lines, +105 words, measured as the audit counts them — the raise is +8, because the
// document stood one line under the old ceiling and that slack was absorbed). Two further
// lessons of that morning were deliberately NOT added here: they are the long-form half and
// live in the retrospective.
// Raised again on 06.08.2026 by ONE genuinely new tip — an alarm keyed on an EVENT is blind
// exactly when the event's own source fails, so what is watched is the STATE (does the served
// thing still match the source?), plus the same lesson's second half, that a sync writing from
// a source may only ADD and never overwrite what is richer downstream. The tip costs +7 lines
// and +67 words gross; ONE neighbouring entry (the versioned-move one, risk half and prompt)
// was tightened by −1 line / −20 words to pay part of it, leaving +6 lines and +47 words net.
// The LINE ceiling is nevertheless LOWERED to the measured fit: the document had drifted 7
// lines under the old 409 and rides that slack, so 408 is the exact count and 417 would have
// been room for a whole future entry — the four-eyes review caught precisely that.
export const LIMITS = {

  // EXACT FIT, not headroom — corrected 30.07.2026 after the four-eyes review

  // rule above ("raised only by the measured size of genuinely new tips")
  // converges on zero slack by construction, and granting slack would itself be
  // the unearned loosening the rule forbids. So any net growth blocks, and the
  // block message names the honest way out: cut the long telling over into the
  // retrospective, which is where it belongs anyway.
  //
  // Raised 07.08.2026 by the measured NET size of one genuinely new tip (§3.91,

  // re-measured with this counter by the four-eyes review: the tip cost 129
  // words as first written, 96 were PAID BACK, 33 is the net raise, and the LINE
  // budget was met with no raise at all. The largest single payer was trimming
  // the TIP ITSELF; the rest came from six neighbouring entries, of which only
  // prose was cut — the one tightening that had dropped a claim ("schreib zu
  // jeder Regel, was sie misst") was restored and repaid inside its own entry.
  // NO per-entry split is recorded here ON PURPOSE: two review rounds each
  // invalidated the previous breakdown, because every internal repayment moves
  // it while the totals stay put. The split lives in the review ledger, which is
  // dated and never rewritten. Recorded as a decision card besides, because the
  // standing rule is shorten-before-raise and the last step of a raise belongs
  // to the user.
