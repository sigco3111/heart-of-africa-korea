// THE LANDING CHAIN, as pure decisions (point 594).
//
// WHAT IT IS. Landing a finished point is always the same six steps — merge the
// feature branch, run the fast gate, tick the work order, move the block into the
// archive, publish the board, delete the worktree — and today it is 8-12 turns of
// the ONE serial session every point passes through, at a median context of 164k.
// Measured over the last window, bookkeeping was 26.0 % of the weighted spend and
// 37.5 % of the machine hours, and 62.3 % of the main session's own cost.
//
// WHY THE DECISIONS ARE PURE AND THE DOING IS NOT. Everything that can go wrong
// here goes wrong QUIETLY: a tick that leaves the point in TASKS.md, an archive
// that gains a duplicate, a publish that reports success on unchanged bytes, a
// gate that ran two of its three steps. So each of those judgments is a function
// with no I/O, pinned in scripts/land-point-core.test.mjs, and the wrapper
// (scripts/land-point.mjs) only performs what these decide.
//
// FAIL LOUD, AND LEAVE NO HALF STATE. The chain stops at the FIRST red step and
// never continues past it — `planFrom` below is what makes that structural rather
// than remembered. Two consequences follow, and both are deliberate:
//   - a step that was never reached is reported as `skipped: not reached`, never
//     as green and never as absent;
//   - the one step that writes two files (tick + archive move) computes BOTH
//     texts before it writes EITHER, so a crash cannot land half of it.
//
// IT BYPASSES NO GUARD. Every step here is one the repository already governs,
// and driving it from a script must not hide it from the mechanism that governs
// it. Two places carry that:
//   - `fenceGuardedAction` in scripts/batch-lease-core.mjs names `land-point.mjs`
//     itself, so a session that has lost the batch lease is refused the whole
//     chain the same way it is refused a bare `git merge`;
//   - the tick+archive transition is handed to `evaluateTasksArchive` (the same
//     core the Stop-hook guard uses) BEFORE it is written, so the chain can never
//     produce a state that guard would block.
