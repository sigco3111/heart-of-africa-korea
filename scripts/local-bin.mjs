// WHERE A LOCALLY INSTALLED TOOL ACTUALLY IS — one resolver, not five copies.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. `resolve(process.cwd(), 'node_modules/.bin/oxlint')` is the
// obvious spelling and it is wrong in the environment most of this project's
// work happens in. CLAUDE.md §6 builds every point in a git WORKTREE;
// `node_modules/` is git-ignored, so it is not there, and the spawn fails with
// ENOENT. That cost every delegated agent a detour — and worse, it made a whole
// suite LIE, because a spawn that never started exits non-zero exactly like a
// tool that ran and rejected (see `assertRan` below, and scope.test.mjs).
//
// THE ORDER, and why each step earns its place:
//  1. WALK UP from the checkout. Node itself resolves modules by walking
//     ancestors, so a nested package or a worktree that happens to live inside
//     the main checkout is served here, and the nearest install wins.
//  2. THE MAIN WORKING TREE, derived from git's COMMON directory. A worktree
//     placed OUTSIDE the main checkout shares `<main>/.git` and nothing else,
//     so no amount of walking up reaches the dependencies; git is the only thing
//     that knows where they are. (`scripts/worktree-bootstrap.mjs` normally puts
//     a link in place before any gate runs; this is the belt to that braces.)
//  3. PATH. A globally installed runner is a legitimate way to have the tool,
//     and refusing it would fail a run that could have passed.
// Nothing found is REPORTED, never guessed: `describeMissing` names the tool and
// every directory that was searched, so the reader sees why rather than reading
// ENOENT off a spawn.
