// PostToolUse hook (matcher: every tool). Observe-only duties, each isolated
// and never erroring:
//
// (1) OWNER-ONLY lock heartbeat (hard singleton, 24.07.2026): refresh THIS
//     session's batch lock on every tool call — but ONLY if this session
//     already owns it. It NEVER claims: the old "claim when free/stale" made
//     every tool-using session (a chat window, a stale-lock bystander) grab
//     batch ownership as a side effect — one of the advisory holes behind the
//     e9407cae double-session incident. Acquisition now happens exclusively in
//     the SessionStart hook and the batch-progress-guard, through the atomic
//     acquire in scripts/batch-singleton.mjs.
// (2) Parallel-session presence: stamp this session id's tool activity into
//     .claude/session-activity.json — the active detector's raw signal (a
//     NON-owner top-level session with fresh activity in this repo = a
//     parallel session).
// (3) Stamp .claude/tool-activity.json — the dashboard Stop guard's
//     focus-freshness invariant needs to know that real work happened.
// (4) LEGACY (claude.ai artifact, retired 29.07.2026) — detect a dashboard
//     publish through the mirror: when the Artifact tool is called on the
//     dashboard file, record the published content's sha256 in
//     dashboard-state.json ("published" vs "merely edited", invariant 9). The
//     live transport is scripts/board-publish.mjs, which records its own hash;
//     this branch only keeps an old record honest and is otherwise dormant.
//     The tool's RESPONSE decides whether it counts — a failed publish records
//     publishFailed and no hash, so the board can never be believed live on the
//     strength of an attempt alone (four-eyes finding 28.07.2026).
// (5) THE BOARD-PUBLISH DUE MARK (point 400, delta A): hash the open-point set
//     after each call and, on a CHANGE, set `publishDue`. It lives HERE rather
//     than in a PostToolUse matcher of its own because .claude/settings.json is
//     a protected path an unattended session cannot edit — and because an
//     `Edit|Write` matcher would miss every TASKS.md change made through Bash
//     (a merge, the archive move). The mark is PERSISTED, so a session that dies
//     between the change and the publish hands it to its successor.
// (6) THE USER'S MESSAGE, DELIVERED WHILE THE SESSION WORKS (point 406): read
//     the LOCAL chat spool — never the network, a hook on every tool call must
//     not do network I/O — and inject what it finds as `additionalContext`. This
//     is the only duty here that WRITES to stdout, and it writes exactly nothing
//     while the spool is empty: injected context is re-sent with every later
//     request, so even a "no new messages" line would cost tokens at tool-call
//     rate. Owner-only and silent under a user pause, like every guard here.
// (7) THE DISPOSSESSION NOTICE (point 556): a session whose fence has been
//     superseded is TOLD so here, at its very next hook, instead of discovering
//     it at a denied merge. On 08.08.2026 an owner mid-verification lost the
//     batch to an expired lease and went on running browser suites it could no
//     longer merge. It speaks ONCE per fence number, stands down for a paused
//     batch and for every session that never held a fence, and shares duty (6)'s
//     channel — the two can never collide, since a fenced-out session is by
//     definition not the owner duty (6) speaks for.
// (8) THE WAIT MARKER (point 592): while a verify run is provably going, write
//     the `batch-in-flight` declaration on the session's behalf — and withdraw
//     it again the moment that run is over. Measured, the idle holder it
//     replaces (`echo idle`, and the hand-typed `--waiting-on`) cost 1189
//     responses in six days, 3.6 % of the weighted spend, for a turn that does
//     nothing but feed a counter. It writes the SAME declaration in the SAME
//     shape, so `batch-progress-guard` re-probes it exactly as it re-probes a
//     hand-written one and cannot go blind on it. It lives here for duty (5)'s
//     reason — .claude/settings.json is a protected path an unattended session
//     cannot edit — and with no verify run record on disk it costs one readdir.
