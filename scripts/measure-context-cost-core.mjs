// The claim to test: 80–94 % of the token spend sat above 150k of context because one
// session carried point after point, and at 24/7 that is 1.25 %/h of the weekly quota
// where ~0.6 %/h is what fits. So the numbers that matter are the SHARE of spend from
// large-context turns and the spend PER ACTIVE HOUR — before the boundary went live
// and after.

 * appears on a later line is not lost, and no counter is double-counted the way summing
 * the lines would (that inflates the raw total by 38 %). The rule was checked against the
 * raw transcripts rather than assumed: `input_tokens` never varies within a response,
 * `cache_read_input_tokens` varies in one response and rises, and the ONE case where a
