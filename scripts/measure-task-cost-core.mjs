// WHERE THE TIME AND THE TOKENS OF ONE TASK ACTUALLY GO (point 572, phase 1). The
// pure decision half; `scripts/measure-task-cost.mjs` reads the transcripts and git.
//
// `scripts/measure-context-cost-core.mjs` answers "how much did we spend per hour, and
// how much of it above 150k context". It does NOT answer "which PART of a task that
// spend belongs to" — brief, implementation, gates, verification, merge, bookkeeping.
// This module adds exactly that attribution and REUSES the older module's weighting
// (`turnCost`) and its idle-gap rule unchanged, so the two tools cannot disagree about
// what a token or an active hour is.
//
// WHY THE OLD WEIGHTING STILL HOLDS for a per-phase split: `turnCost` is LINEAR in a
// turn's usage counters, so splitting one turn's cost across the phases it touched is
// the same operation on the weighted proxy as on the raw token count. Both are reported
// side by side; the weighted number is a PROXY for the bill, never the bill.
//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, stated up front because a measurement that hides its blind spot
// is worse than none:
//   - A turn is attributed from the TOOL CALLS it issued. A turn that only thinks and
//     writes prose carries no such evidence and goes to `unattributed` — never guessed
//     into a phase.
//   - Shell plumbing (`grep`, `git status`, `cat`) appears in every phase and is
//     deliberately given NO vote. It does not distort a turn that also did something
//     identifiable; it leaves a turn that did nothing else unattributed.
//   - Transcript hours are MACHINE hours. Delegated agents run in parallel, so summing
//     them across sessions is not calendar time. Calendar time per point comes from git
//     (`mergeSpans`), and the two are reported as two different clocks.

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — it repairs a measured defect, not a hypothetical one. The harness
 * writes ONE assistant response onto SEVERAL lines, one per content block (`thinking`,
 * `text`, `tool_use`, `tool_use`). Deduplicating by `message.id` and keeping the FIRST
 * line threw the tool calls away whenever the response began with thinking, which is the
 * normal case. Measured before this fold: 25,6 % of responses looked like they issued a
 * tool call, and NO response ever looked like it issued two. Both were artefacts of the
 * dedup, and both were reported as findings about the work.
 *
 * THE SECOND HALF OF THAT DEFECT (four-eyes review, 09.08.2026): keeping the first line
 * was not right for the token sums either. The lines do not repeat the same usage —
 * `output_tokens` grows across them — so the fold takes each counter's MAXIMUM through
 * the shared `foldUsage`, the same function `measure-context-cost.mjs` folds with, so the
 * two tools cannot report different token sums. See `foldUsage` for the measurement that
 * settles the rule.
 *
 * So: the usage is `foldUsage` over the response's lines, the identifying fields come
 * from the FIRST line, the timestamp is the EARLIEST, and the tool calls are the UNION
 * over all lines, deduplicated by the block's own `id` (a streamed block can repeat) and
 * falling back to name+input where a line carries none.
