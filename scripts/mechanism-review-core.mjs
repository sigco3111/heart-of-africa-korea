//
// WHY IT EXISTS: "a new or changed guard is reviewed by the SECOND model before
// it goes live" is this project's own exemplar of enforcing rather than
// remembering — and the rule-corpus audit found it claimed a Stop check that had
// never been built. Carried by intention alone, it was skipped in exactly the
// cases where it mattered: the pre-push gate went live before its review, and
// the review then found that its "documents only" fast path waved through the
// very files this repository measures in its unit layer. The gate would have
// been useless in its most common case, green on every test. Two further
// mechanisms reviewed the same day yielded three defects each.
//
// So the rule gets a mechanism of its own: a mechanism change that has no
// RECORDED review by a DIFFERENT model does not get to end the turn.
//
// Side-effect free — the git work, the state files and the block belong to
// scripts/mechanism-review-guard.mjs (fail-open) and the record CLI
