// Stop hook (point 377): the four-eyes rule for a MECHANISM gets its own
// mechanism.
//
// "A new or changed guard is reviewed by the second model before it goes live"
// was the project's exemplar of enforcing rather than remembering — and the
// rule-corpus audit found it claimed a Stop check that had never been built. It
// was skipped in exactly the cases where it mattered. So: when the commits since
// the last confirmed baseline add or change a guard, a gate, a core beside one or
// a versioned git hook, the turn does not end until a review by a DIFFERENT model
// is recorded for that change.
//
// Decision logic: mechanism-review-core.mjs (pure, Vitest-covered). This wrapper
// only gathers git output and the two state files, and is fail-OPEN — an internal
// error never traps the session. It stands down while .claude/batch-paused exists
// and for a session that does not own the batch lock.
//
// GRANDFATHERING: the baseline is per branch and self-arms at the current HEAD on
// its first run, exactly as model-guard does with its timestamp. The twenty-odd
// guards that predate this gate therefore owe nothing; the point is the next
// mechanism, not a review debt for the existing ones.
//
// How the gate clears:
//   node scripts/mechanism-review.mjs --record <sha> --model <name> \
//       --verdict <merge|merge-with-fixes|do-not-merge> --evidence "<one line>" \
//       --mode <review|blind-parallel>
// CLI:
//   node scripts/mechanism-review-guard.mjs --status

 * was green locally. Its budget had already been raised once; a second raise
 * would have hidden it again.
 *
 * WORST CASE, and it does not depend on the ledger's size: 1 + R calls, where R
 * is the number of records that lie on THIS branch (in practice a handful, and
 * zero on the overwhelmingly common turn, which has no pending mechanism commit
 * at all). Never 1 per pair, never 1 per ledger line. `revList(rev)` answers
 * "everything `rev` reaches that `effective` does not".
 *
 * The narrowing to branch records is EXACT, not an approximation: a record can
 * only cover a pending commit when that commit is reachable from the record's
 * sha and NOT from `effective`, so the record's own sha must itself lie in
 * `effective..head`. A record at or before `effective` reaches nothing that
