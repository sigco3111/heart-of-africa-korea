//   node scripts/mechanism-review.mjs --list
//
// `--mode` names which half of the four-eyes principle the verdict covers
// (CLAUDE.md §6, point 541). Only the CONVERGENT half had an enforcer; nothing
// recorded whether a DIVERGENT step ran blind parallel or as a review of an
// already-finished list — the anchoring failure the rule exists to prevent — and
// no guard can detect that, because it stands in no file. So the recorder asks,
// and refuses to default the answer.
//
// `--point <N>` names the work-order point the review settles. It is what the
// CRITICALITY gate (point 298, criticality-review-guard.mjs) looks for: that gate
// judges a change by its DECLARED criticality rather than by its file path, so a
// high-criticality point with no mechanism file in its diff is covered too. One
// ledger and one command serve both gates — a guard change that closes a high
// point is recorded ONCE, with the point named.
//
// The record is the hard part of this rule, so it is kept cheap and honest: one
// appended line naming which model reviewed, how it ended, one line of evidence,
// and the commit it judged — plus the model that AUTHORED that commit, read from
// its own Co-Authored-By trailer rather than typed in. A self-review is REFUSED
// here (and again at the gate), because a self-review in the ledger is worse than
// an empty one: the gate then reads green.
//
// The ledger is TRACKED in git on purpose. A review happens on a feature branch
// and the gate bites in the session that MERGES it; an untracked file would never
// make that journey, and the branch would block on a review that had been done.
// One JSON object per line so two branches appending never conflict beyond the
// last line.
//
// The decision logic is pure (mechanism-review-core.mjs); this file does I/O and
// fails LOUD — it is a command, not a hook.
