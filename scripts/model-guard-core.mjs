// Pure decision core of the serving-model tripwire (point 309): on 24.07.2026
// the session silently degraded to Haiku 4.5 and merged defective work; the
// Co-Authored-By trailer in `git log` is the one mechanical record of WHO
// actually authored a commit. This module only decides — no I/O; the gathering
// and blocking live in the fail-open wrapper scripts/model-guard.mjs.
//
// Model policy (user, 25.07.2026): ONLY Opus 5 (default), Opus 4.8 (fallback
// when Opus 5 is unavailable) and Fable 5 (occasional four-eyes work) may run
// the batch. Every other model — Sonnet and Haiku included — is a policy
// breach: the batch must stop rather than run on it. Hence an ALLOWLIST, not
// a Haiku blocklist: an unknown future model name fails closed.

// AN UNNAMED AUTHOR IS NOT A FORBIDDEN ONE (point 397, observed 28.07.2026 and
// again on 29.07.2026): commits carrying the bare `Co-Authored-By: Claude
// <noreply@anthropic.com>` — the trailer with no model name at all — failed the
// allowlist exactly as a Haiku trailer does and demanded the full breach ritual,
// though every session live in that window was Opus 5. The guard is not softened:
// a bare trailer is no proof of compliance either. It is SPLIT, because the two
// states have different answers — a forbidden model stops the batch, an
// unidentified one is LOOKED UP in the local transcripts and then resolved.

// THE ALLOWLIST JUDGES THE PARSED NAME, NEVER THE RAW LINE (point 527, found
// 06.08.2026 by the four-eyes review of points 397/425, recorded as C9 in
// docs/rule-corpus-audit.md). `ALLOWED` used to be searched inside the whole
// trailer, so any line merely CONTAINING "opus" or "fable" passed the guard
// whose entire purpose is to catch a silently degraded session — a
// `Claude Haiku 4.5 (opus mode)` or a `Claude Sonnet 5 / Claude Opus 5` walked
// straight through. The name is therefore parsed out first and matched WHOLE,
// and a trailer claiming more than one model is a finding rather than a pass on
// its first allowed name: a commit has exactly one authoring model.
