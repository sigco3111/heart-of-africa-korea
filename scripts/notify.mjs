// Usage: node scripts/notify.mjs "<title>" "<message>" [priority]
//    or: import { notify } from './notify.mjs'; await notify(title, message)
// Silent no-op if disabled (delete .claude/ntfy-topic to turn off).

 * Send an alert — through the ESCALATION LADDER (point 434).
 *
 * A repeated IDENTICAL alert no longer repeats identically: it backs off with a
 * rising interval and a rising priority, and its last rung PAUSES the batch with
 * a board card, because an alert can be slept through and a paused batch cannot.
 * The decision is `scripts/alert-escalation-core.mjs`; the state, the pause and
 * the card are `scripts/alert-escalation.mjs`, imported LAZILY so this module
 * stays a two-import leaf for every caller — and so a test that imports `notify`
 * never drags in the batch-lock path that throws under a test runner.
 *
 * @param {object}  [opts]
 * @param {string}  [opts.key]       an explicit ladder key; else derived from
 *                                   title+message with digit runs collapsed, so
 *                                   "stalled for 121 min" and "…151 min" are ONE
 *                                   climbing alert rather than two fresh ones.
 * @param {boolean} [opts.escalate]  false sends unthrottled — for the rare alert
 *                                   whose every repetition is genuinely news.
 * @param {string}  [opts.topicFile] where the topic is read from (tests only).
 * @param {object}  [opts.escalation] injected ladder module (tests only).
 * @returns {Promise<boolean>} true when the message went out. FALSE also means
 *          "held back by the ladder", not only "failed"; the ladder log
 *          (.claude/resilience/alert-escalation.log) says which of the two it was.
 *
 * THE PRIORITY IS PART OF THE CONTRACT, not decoration: an alert posted at
 * `high`/`urgent` is a standing CONDITION and its ladder may end in a paused
 * batch, while one posted at `low`/`default` is an EVENT and can only ever be
 * throttled. A caller that notifies about something routine and recurring must
 * not declare it urgent.
