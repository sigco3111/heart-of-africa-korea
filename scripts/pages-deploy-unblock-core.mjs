// Pure decision logic for clearing a stuck GitHub Pages deployment
// (pages-deploy-unblock.mjs). No I/O, never throws — Vitest-covered in
// pages-deploy-unblock-core.test.mjs.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS (measured 06.08.2026 on `main`): a Pages deployment was
// accepted by GitHub and then sat in `deployment_in_progress` until the deploy
// action gave up with `Timeout reached, aborting!`. Its own cancel did not take
// effect, so the deployment stayed IN PROGRESS on GitHub's side and every later
// deployment was refused — the re-run and a `workflow_dispatch` were answered
// `Deployment cancelled.`, the next commit's run with `Deployment request
// failed … due to in progress deployment. Please cancel <sha> first`. The site
// then served a two-hour-old `main` while the user judges every render change
// against exactly that site, and nothing in the repository knew the handle:
// cancel the stuck deployment through the Pages API, then deploy again.
//
// The BUILD/GITHUB split is structural, not guessed from a log: our build runs
// in the `build` job, and the `deploy` job only talks to the Pages API. So a
// retry driven from here can never re-run (and never mask) a failing build —
// `deploy` does not even start unless `build` succeeded.
