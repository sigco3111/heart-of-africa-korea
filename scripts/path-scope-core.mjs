// Pure decision core of the path-scope guard (path-scope-guard.mjs is the thin
// fail-open PreToolUse wrapper).
//
// WHAT IT IS. The real ALLOW-list for filesystem access, agreed with the user on
// 29.07.2026. The permission layer's deny-rules cannot express the two shapes
// that actually matter here:
//   * `~/Documents` MINUS the project — a deny-rule is a pattern, and "everything
//     under Documents except this one subtree" is not one it can state;
//   * the worktree agents, whose rules live in the UNTRACKED
//     `.claude/settings.local.json`, so they travel with no clone and are gone
//     after any machine move.
// So the rule is stated once, here, in the repository, as an allow-list: the
// repo and its worktrees, the scratchpads, the Claude config, the browser cache
// and the toolchain are in scope, and everything else is out of it and is
// DENIED WITH ITS REASON — never silently.
//
// NORMALISATION IS THE POINT. This machine writes the same directory five ways —
// `C:\Users\Patri\…`, `c:/Users/Patri/…`, `/c/Users/Patri/…` (git-bash),
// `/mnt/c/Users/Patri/…` (WSL) and `~/…`. A rule that judged the SPELLING would
// be a rule with four holes, so every form is folded onto one canonical shape
// first and the verdict is taken on that. `canonicalisePath` is where that
// happens and `~` is its home token, whichever host is running.
//
// FAIL DIRECTION: allow, at three levels.
//   1. A command whose paths cannot be READ OFF it — an unbalanced quote, a
//      `$(…)` or a backtick that computes the path — is UNPARSEABLE and allows.
//   2. QUOTED TEXT NEVER DECIDES beyond a path-shaped word: a regex, a here-doc
//      body or a `node -e` one-liner mentioning a path is prose, not access
//      (the lesson of point 473 — the fence that judged the command STRING
//      refused a read-only search for merely naming a script).
//   3. A bare posix token whose top-level directory does not exist on this
//      machine is not a path at all — `sed -n '/VERIFIABLE/,/WHAT/p'` names no
//      file. Drive- and `~`-rooted forms skip that test, because their shape is
//      unambiguous and they must judge identically on a host where the drive is
//      not mounted.
// A missed access costs one wrong read; a false deny costs the session its
// ability to work, and one block-loop cost this project ~30 turns (point 278).
