// THE RESTART-CLOCK DRILL (point 445).
//
// The Vitest layer proves the DECISION (scripts/batch-pause-core.test.mjs); this
// proves the WIRING: that the real launcher tick — `node scripts/batch-autostart.mjs`,
// the same process, the same code path, the same classification — parks on a clock
// that is still running and RESUMES the batch the moment it runs out.
//
// It parks with a SIXTY-SECOND clock and waits it out on the real wall clock, so
// what the drill measures is the mechanism and not a mocked "now".
//
// HOW IT STAYS SAFE ON A LIVE MACHINE. It never writes `.claude/batch-paused`: the
// record it parks with is its own file under the git-ignored local/, handed to the
// launcher's `--pause-report <file>` mode, which runs the real classification and
// exits BEFORE the tick's first side effect. So the drill spawns no session, clears
// no record, touches no state file, and cannot become a second owner beside a
// running batch. The live pause record is read once, before and after, purely to
// assert that the drill left it alone.
//
// WHAT IT THEREFORE DOES NOT MEASURE (four-eyes review, Fable 5, finding 5): the
// retry BRANCH — the `rmSync`, the cleared `failCount`, the spawn that follows — does
// not execute here, because executing it would be the competing session this drill
// must not start. What the drill proves is the verdict the live tick acts on, in the
// live tick's own process; that the branch is wired to that verdict is pinned by the
// source witnesses in scripts/batch-autostart.test.mjs.
//
