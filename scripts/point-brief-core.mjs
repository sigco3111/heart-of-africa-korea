// Pure core of the point brief (point 365 A, user 26.07.2026).
//
// WHY: an agent delegated a work-order point orients by reading whole documents
// before it sees a line of source — measured TASKS.md ~59k tokens plus design.md
// ~46k, uncached, per agent, to find a spec of a few hundred words. The brief
// replaces that reading assignment: the point verbatim, the design.md sections
// its spec names, and a one-line identification per cross-referenced point.
//
// THE BRIEF MUST NOT STARVE ITS READER — a smaller context that costs a rebuild
// is no saving. Hence two hard failures instead of a silent omission: an unknown
// point number, and a `§` reference that resolves in none of the documents
// searched (a renumbering must error, not quietly drop a section). Everything the
// resolver cannot carry is NAMED in the brief's reference map, never dropped.
//
// THE BRIEF MUST NOT LIE TO ITS READER EITHER. The work order writes `§` for four
// different things — a design.md section, a CLAUDE.md section, a section of a
// research document (`peoples-1890 §8`, `climate §1.1`, `fauna-behaviour-1890
// §B2.1`), and, sloppily, a work-order POINT number. A resolver that knows only
// design.md carries design.md §8 where the spec meant peoples-1890 §8, verbatim
// and without a word — the reader cannot tell. So every reference is resolved
// against ALL of them, every carried section is LABELLED with the document it
// came from, and the reference map lists every `§` and where it went.
//
// AND WHERE IT CANNOT KNOW, IT SAYS SO. Two ambiguities are structural, not
// fixable by a better cascade: the same `§N` heading id living in two documents
// (design.md §4.4 "Landmarks" and fauna-behaviour-1890 §4.4 "Vultures and the
// dying animal" — existence cannot decide between them), and a bare `§N` that may
// be a CLAUDE.md §7.1 acceptance criterion, which is a LIST ITEM no resolver can
// reach. Both are printed with the alternative NAMED on the map line, because a
// confident wrong identification is the one failure this tool cannot afford.
//
// This module is pure: text in, text out, no I/O. scripts/point-brief.mjs is the
// I/O wrapper (same split as doc-budget-core.mjs / doc-budget-guard.mjs).

 * REFERENCING WORDING and never by a hand-kept list (a list would need editing
 * for every new point, and the one nobody edited is the one that starves its
 * reader).
 *
 * WHY BY WORDING. Point 488's text says "Point 352's specification is binding
 * with one amendment from point 482". The brief carried one identifying line per
 * cross-referenced point, so the part declared BINDING was exactly the part
 * missing, and the building agent had to cut point 352's brief for itself before
 * it could start. A point merely named for orientation — "one amendment from
 * point 482", whose amendment the sentence then states — needs no such thing.
 *
 * The set is deliberately narrow: each entry names a construction that says the
 * OTHER point's text governs here, not one that merely points at it. A missed
 * adoption costs one extra `point-brief.mjs N` run, exactly today's cost; a
 * false one inlines a whole body into every brief that mentions the point, so
 * the errors are not symmetric and the conservative side is the right one.

 * HOW TO SPEND A TURN (point 593). Binding, and deliberately carried by the

 *
 * WHY IT IS WORTH THE LINES IT COSTS. Measured over this project's own

 * search/read alone is 25.1 % of the weighted spend, and 4036 responses —
 * 15.2 % of all output — repeated an EXACTLY identical shell command inside a
 * single session. One saved response is ~22.9k weighted tokens and 24.4 s of
 * MACHINE time (not calendar time: up to three agents run in parallel, so this
 * only becomes wall clock on the critical path).
 *
 * The paragraph NAMES its recurring candidates instead of stating the
 * principle, because the principle was already obvious and still was not
 * followed. It also names both ways the shortcut goes wrong — bundling a call
 * that needs another's OUTPUT, and re-using a fact that has since changed — so
 * the rule cannot be read as "batch everything, read nothing twice".
