// Pre-push wrapper for the fast gate (point 302). Reads git's pre-push stdin,
// asks the pure core which steps this push must survive, runs them, and refuses
// the push on any red — so CI never becomes the first place a broken state is
// noticed, and the user never gets the failure mail.
//
// FAIL-OPEN on an internal error (a missing git, an unreadable range): a broken
// guard must never make the repository unpushable. A real red, however, fails
// CLOSED — that is the whole point. `git push --no-verify` remains the explicit,
// visible exception.
//
// A RED UNDER LOAD IS NOT EVIDENCE (point 389, the rule of point 296 applied
// here at last). The gate used to measure the machine as much as the code: on
// 28.07.2026 `npm run test:unit` passed standing alone, three times, while the
// same command inside this gate reported red and refused the push, because two
// delegated agents were working and the CPU sat at 45 %. So on a red the gate
// asks `scripts/verify/machine-load.mjs`, and if the machine is not quiet it
// re-runs THAT step ONCE and uses the second result. The bar itself is
// unchanged: a red on a quiet machine blocks immediately, a step that fails
// twice blocks whatever the machine says, and nothing is skipped, warned-about
// instead of blocked, or bypassed. The only question the retry answers is
// whether the first red was evidence.
//
// Every retry PRINTS what is being re-run and why — a silent retry would hide a
// real intermittent defect, which is exactly what the house rule about visible
// retries exists to prevent — and the wrapper times the second attempt, so the
// cost of the retry is measured rather than assumed.
// A PASSING COUNT OVER A SET THAT SILENTLY SHRANK (point 404). The unit step's
// output is CAPTURED as well as printed, so the gate can read how many test
// FILES actually ran and compare that with the last green run's own count. A
// suite that cannot load does not fail — it vanishes from the totals — so a
// damaged dependency tree reports greener than a red run unless someone counts.
//
// And the count is compared with the TREE, not only with the memory: a suite
// genuinely deleted leaves the checkout, an unloadable one is still lying in it.
// That is what tells "understood and deliberate" from "re-ran without fixing" —
// the first version blocked once and recorded the lower number as it blocked, so
// a second push with the tree still damaged sailed through (four-eyes finding).
