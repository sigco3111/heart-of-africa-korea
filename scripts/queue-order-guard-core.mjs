// Pure decision logic of the queue-order Stop-hook guard (queue-order-guard.mjs
// is the thin fail-open I/O wrapper). Kept side-effect-free so the Vitest layer
// can sweep every rule without fs/git (scripts/queue-order-guard-core.test.mjs).
//
// Three invariants the assistant repeatedly got wrong, now ENFORCED at turn end:
//   (1) QUEUE ORDER — known-bug FIXES and user-requested extensions are worked
//       BEFORE the big bug-FINDING / QA-framework tickets (memory
//       queue-order-fixes-before-finders). A finder card queued ahead of open
//       fix work blocks the turn.
//   (1b) QUEUE AGREEMENT (point 608) — the sequence the board RENDERS is the one
//       the work order DERIVES. Rule (1) judges completeness of a ranking, not
//       agreement of two documents, so it stayed green through both re-sequencings
//       of 10.08.2026 while the published board kept showing the old plan. The
//       user found that before any check did.
//   (2) DASHBOARD TRUTH — a queue/now card must not CLAIM its point is done
//       ("behoben", "erledigt", …) while that point is still open ([ ]) in
//       TASKS.md. A conservative negation/qualifier window keeps honest
//       retractions ("NICHT gelöst", "die 'behoben'-Behauptung war FALSCH") and
//       sub-work notes ("Diagnose-Vorarbeit erledigt", "(b) erledigt") from
//       tripping it — better a missed claim than a false block.
// Fail-open is the WRAPPER's job; this core must never throw on partial input.
// The remedies' publish steps come from scripts/board-remedy.mjs — one copy.
