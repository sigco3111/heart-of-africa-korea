// GUI/rendering/shader change must be verified on BOTH renderer backends
// (`VERIFY_GL=webgpu` AND `VERIFY_GL=webgl`), judged by the rendered picture,
// before it is committed/ticked/called done. This core decides, from committed
// render-path changes and the mechanically recorded verify runs, whether the
// turn may end. Fail-open is the WRAPPER's job; this core only decides on the
// inputs it is handed and must never throw on partial ones.
//
// A run covers a backend when it is CLEAN (exit 0) or ACCOUNTED FOR (point 550):
// every failing check and console error in it charged to an OPEN work-order
// point. The two are never conflated — see runVerdict.
