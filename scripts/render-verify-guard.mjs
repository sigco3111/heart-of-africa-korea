// Stop hook (user mandate 22.07.2026): GUARANTEE that no GUI/rendering/shader
// change is committed/ticked/called done without a verify run on BOTH renderer
// backends — WebGPU (the user's real backend) AND the WebGL2 fallback — judged
// by the rendered picture. A reminder already failed (the point-210 sea-coast
// fix was "done" on WebGL2 while WebGPU still showed the staircase), so this
// BLOCKS turn-end while a committed render-path change lacks a recorded passing
// run per backend. The decision logic lives in render-verify-core.mjs (pure,
// Vitest-covered); runs are recorded mechanically from INSIDE each verify-suite
// process (render-verify-recorder.mjs, armed by scripts/verify/_browser.mjs).
// This wrapper only gathers inputs and is fail-OPEN: any internal error →
// allow, so a guard bug never traps the session.
//
// How the gate clears, mechanically:
//   VERIFY_GL=webgpu node scripts/verify/run-all.mjs <suite>   # exit 0 recorded
//   VERIFY_GL=webgl  node scripts/verify/run-all.mjs <suite>   # exit 0 recorded
// A run only counts if it finished AFTER the last edit of any changed render
// file (an earlier run cannot have seen the final code). When both backends are
// covered the guard advances the verified baseline (clearedHead) by itself —
// no manual ritual.
//
// A run counts as covering when it is CLEAN (exit 0) or ACCOUNTED FOR (point
// 550): every red in it charged to an OPEN work-order point. The clearance is
// recorded as `clearedVia: 'accounted-for'` with the charges, and said out loud
// — a suite that cannot exit 0 for another point's reasons must not force a
// hand-written --defer on every change, and it must not read as a pass either.
// CLI:
//   node scripts/render-verify-guard.mjs status            # inspect the gate
//   node scripts/render-verify-guard.mjs --defer "<why>"   # loud escape valve
//   node scripts/render-verify-guard.mjs --clear "<why>"   # manual baseline advance
