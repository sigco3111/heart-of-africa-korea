// that re-baselined, so any transient failure — an `index.lock` collision, a
// throwing ownership probe — permanently cleared a pending, unverified gate, and
// a non-owner session could overwrite the owner's baseline. Fail-open ONCE had
// become fail-open forever.
//
// The rule these tests pin: exactly one error source (the baseline↔HEAD diff)
// raises BaselineDiffError and re-baselines; every other source raises a plain
// error, which the Stop hook lets fall through to its outer catch — stop allowed,
// state untouched, gate still pending on the next turn.
