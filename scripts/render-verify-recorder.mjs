// Mechanical evidence that a verify suite REALLY ran on a given renderer
// backend (point 210's lesson: the sea-coast fix was called done after a
// WebGL2-only check while the user's WebGPU picture was still broken). Armed by
// scripts/verify/_browser.mjs the moment a suite launches its browser; on
// process exit it appends a run record — backend, suite name, exit code,
// whether assertBackend confirmed the backend, and the screenshots the run
// actually wrote — to .claude/render-verify-state.json. The Stop-hook
// render-verify-guard.mjs judges dual-backend coverage from these records, so
// "I ran it" can never be a hollow claim: the record only exists when the suite
// process itself wrote it.
//
// A `--section` run is recorded PARTIAL (point 566): it exercised one named
// block of the suite, so runVerdict refuses the record as coverage whatever its
// exit code. The flag comes from the env the runner set, never from the suite —
// a suite cannot forget to declare its own partiality.
//
// A RED run is recorded with its REDS (point 550): every failing check and
// console error it printed, each charged to the open work-order point that owns
// it (scripts/render-verify-charges.mjs) or to nothing. That is what lets the
// guard accept a run whose reds all belong to other points while still recording
// it as ACCOUNTED FOR rather than as a pass — see runVerdict in
// render-verify-core.mjs. Charging happens HERE, at record time, so the record
// says what was charged and no later ledger edit can bless a finished run.
//
// Observe-only and total: every step is wrapped so the bookkeeping can NEVER
// fail a verify suite.
