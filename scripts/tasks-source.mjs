// One place that knows the work order is stored in TWO files (user 26.07.2026).
//
// WHY: TASKS.md had grown to 13 000 lines, of which 10 000 were points long since
// finished. Every turn that consulted the work order carried that history along.
// The finished points therefore moved to docs/tasks-archive.md, verbatim and in
// order, and TASKS.md keeps only the OPEN work plus its framing sections.
//
// Consumers split into two kinds, and confusing them is the way this change
// breaks something:
//   - Those that ask "what is still to do" (the resume hook, the progress guard,
//     the queue-order guard) read TASKS.md alone — the archive holds nothing open.
//   - Those that need the FULL universe of point numbers, because they must
//     recognise a point as CLOSED (the dashboard integrity, card-topic and sync
//     checks: a queue card whose point is ticked is stale), read both through
//     `readTasksAll` below.
// A consumer of the second kind that forgets the archive silently stops seeing
// finished points — it would not fail, it would just never complain again.

 * of 26.07.2026 a ticked point LEAVES TASKS.md at once — looking for `- [x]`
 * here could never succeed again, and every all-DEFERRED file would raise a
 * false alarm.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in either caller because two of them now ask:
 * scripts/batch-autostart.mjs (which may not resurrect a batch on an
 * unreadable work order) and scripts/chat-watcher.mjs (which may not wake a
 * responder on one). A second copy of the rule would drift silently — both
