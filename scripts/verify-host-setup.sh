# Bring this host's picture verification up to BOTH backends and onto the real GPU.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (measured on the container 04.08.2026, point 493). When the browser
# suites moved into the Linux container they ran single-lane and software-only, and every
# reason given for that turned out to be a missing package rather than a missing device:
#   - /dev/dxg IS passed through and /usr/lib/wsl/lib carries libd3d12/libd3d12core/
#     libdxcore. The GeForce behind it is reachable; nothing needed to change on the host.
#   - WebGL 2 came up as "ANGLE (…SwiftShader…)" only because libGL/libEGL were absent, so
#     ANGLE's `gl` backend had no driver to sit on. With them installed the same lane comes
#     up as "ANGLE (Microsoft Corporation, D3D12 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti), OpenGL 4.2)"
#     — measured 170 vs 22.7 renderer calls per second on the identical scene, and the
#     `flow` suite went from red-and-unfinished-in-10-minutes to GREEN IN 58 SECONDS.
#   - WebGPU reaches the card too, at the COMPATIBILITY level (point 505, 05.08.2026).
#     Dawn's OpenGLES backend rides the same GL chain, so the same two packages carry both
#     lanes and nothing else is needed for it — see docs/host-environment.md for the flags
#     and the measurement (103.7 vs 15.3 renderer calls per second).
#   - CORE-level WebGPU stays open, and not for want of trying. It needs Vulkan, which here
#     means Dozen (dzn, Vulkan-on-D3D12): Debian 12 ships Mesa 22.3.6 and even the 25.0.7
#     backport is built WITHOUT it, so the loader offered llvmpipe alone. Dozen builds
#     cleanly from the Debian mesa source (--with-dzn below) and `vulkaninfo` then
#     enumerates "Microsoft Direct3D12 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti)" — but Chrome 151
#     DECLINES it, and the cause is measured: that device reports fullDrawIndexUint32 =
#     false, which Dawn's Vulkan backend requires outright, so it discards the device and
#     answers with its own bundled SwiftShader. With the full ICD set visible the browser
#     HANGS at adapter time instead. The dzn build stays here, opt-in, as the starting
#     point for the next attempt (patching that one feature bit, or a newer Dawn).
#
# Everything installs system-wide, so this needs root ONCE. It is idempotent: a second run
# installs nothing and says so.
#
#   sudo bash scripts/verify-host-setup.sh             # install what is missing
#   sudo bash scripts/verify-host-setup.sh --with-dzn  # …and build Dozen (see above)
#   bash scripts/verify-host-setup.sh --check          # no root; report what is missing
#
# PROVE it at the picture afterwards — a package list is not evidence:
