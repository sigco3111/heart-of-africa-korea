// The decision layer of the lurking-crocodile check in enrichments.mjs
// (CLAUDE.md §7.1 pt. 12, design.md §19.16). Kept pure and separate so the rule
// — and above all its TEETH — can be pinned in the Vitest layer instead of only
// by running a browser suite for twenty minutes.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (point 382). The check asks one question: does the lunging
// body read as an ANIMAL rather than as the water it came out of? It used to
// answer that with an absolute channel delta between two rect MEANS, compared
// against a hand-set 45 — and so decided on the second decimal of a colour
// average. It read 44.2 and 44.6 in one evening on a quiet machine (the same
// check twice: the candidate-real signature, not the load one), and 37.5-45.7
// across the fifteen frames measured for this point on both backends — landing
// on the passing side of its own 45 exactly once. The picture was never in
// doubt; the measure was. A mean over the rect DILUTES the body with the water
// beside it, and how much it dilutes moves with the projection, so the number
// carries the zoom and the camera as much as the crocodile.
//
// THE REPLACEMENT is scale-free. Within ONE frame:
//   median colour of the rect  the water (water is the majority of these rects,
//                              so the median pixel IS a water pixel)
//   d_i                        each pixel's L1 distance from that median
//   spread                     the median of the d_i — the water's own scale
//   share                      #{ d_i > sigmas · spread } / (ordinary pixels)
// Multiply every colour distance in the rect by any λ — a brighter sky, a
// darker backend, a passing cloud, a different exposure — and both d_i and
// `spread` scale with it, so the share does not move. Add any constant to every
// channel and nothing moves either. It is a FRACTION of the rect, so the
// projection drops out too. The only absolute left is the 1-unit floor under
// `spread`, which is one 8-bit step: the smallest colour difference that exists.
//
// Bright specular/foam is water, not animal, and is dropped BEFORE anything is
// measured — including before the reference colour is taken. The old code
// excluded foam from the count but left it in the MEAN, so a rect with foam in
// it reported nearly every water pixel as crocodile (measured 2548 of 2613 on an
// unpinned staging that had wandered onto the falls).
