// Triage of a RED verify run, as pure functions (point 294).
//
// Two independent signals, neither of which the runner could read before:
//
//   1. THE REPEAT SIGNATURE. run-all retries a failed browser suite once and
//      used to conclude "FAIL (twice) — a real failure, not a flake" from the
//      bare fact that both runs failed. That is wrong reasoning, and it cost a
//      real triage on 27.07.2026: `enrichments` failed two staging checks on
//      run 1 and a completely different one (the crocodile eye knobs) on the
//      retry, on a machine carrying a unit run plus two agents. Two failures at
//      DIFFERENT places are the signature of LOAD; a defect fails the SAME
//      check twice. So the verdict is drawn from the failing check NAMES, not
//      from the failure count.
//   2. THE BASELINE COMPARISON (point 294 proper). A check that is already red
//      on the pre-change baseline is PRE-EXISTING or a stale check assumption
//      (the 24.07. SSAO ground-edge and proximity-call-fade cases); one that is
//      green on the baseline and red now is a REAL REGRESSION. Re-running a
//      browser suite against a baseline checkout is expensive, so the wrapper
//      (baseline-classify.mjs) does it OPT-IN and only for the checks that
//      failed — this module only decides what the two outputs MEAN.
//
// A third, deliberately WEAK signal corroborates: whether the failing check's
// name has anything to do with the files the change touched. It never decides a
// verdict — it is a hint printed beside one.
//
// Everything here is string-in / verdict-out so the Vitest layer can pin it
// (scripts/verify/baseline-classify.test.mjs); all process work — git, the
// baseline worktree, the dev server, the suite spawn — lives in the wrapper.

 * suite, it is a suite that never reached the end, and folding it into
 * "the check did not run on the baseline" hid it behind the same wording a
 * genuinely NEWER check gets. A lane that dies at a quarter of the suite costs
 * the full runtime and answers nothing, so it must be LOUD.
 *
 * A death REQUIRES that the run printed NO failing check. That is the whole
 * distinction: a run with FAIL lines did what it was asked — it reported. A run
 * with none and a non-zero exit reported nothing, so its exit came from
 * somewhere else. Two signatures on top of that, either one sufficient:
 *   short  — it reached FEWER checks than the current run did (needs the current

 *   silent — it exited non-zero (needs the exit code; available whenever the run

 * A run that printed NOTHING at all is the pre-existing "did not run" case, not
 * a death — foldBaselineRuns reports that through `ran`.
 *
 * A run that exited ZERO is never a death, whatever it counted: the exit is the
 * suite's last statement, so reaching it means reaching the end. Some checks are
 * conditional on what the app produced, so a healthy baseline may legitimately
 * count a few short — and calling that a death would cry wolf on every run.
 * A killed run (no exit code at all) counts as non-zero.
 *
 * The shortfall alone must NOT annul a run that failed properly: the serverless
 * suites run the BASELINE's own copy of the script, so a change that ADDS checks
 * leaves a legitimately red baseline permanently shorter, and stamping "nothing
 * below is a verdict" over that valid triage every time is the same false alarm
 * in the other direction. `baselineShortfall` names it as a caveat instead.
