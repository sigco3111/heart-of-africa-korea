// Pure decision core for the FRAME SHUTTER (point 375).
//
// A verification frame must show what its name claims. Two runs of the `world`
// suite on IDENTICAL code photographed different places: `12-worldmodel-lake-
// victoria` captured the settled lake in one run and a mid-travel landscape in
// the other — and BOTH runs exited 0, because a suite's assertions never look
// at the frame it writes. The reviewer is then handed a picture that does not
// show its subject and nothing reports it.
//
// So the check moves to the SHUTTER: before a frame is written its subject is
// asserted to be IN the rendered picture, projected through the live camera
// (`__camera.onScreen`/`ndc` in the bird's-eye view, the place camera's own
// matrices inside a settlement) exactly as the CLAUDE.md §7.2 rule already
// demands of every in-view claim — never through an assumed radius. A frame
// whose subject is absent FAILS the suite naming the frame and what was found
// instead; it is never written as if it were the evidence.
//
// The declaration is EXPLICIT, never inferred from the filename: every frame
// states either its subject or that it deliberately photographs a general view
// (with the reason). `findRawFrames` is the gate that keeps it that way — a
// `page.screenshot({ path })` outside the shutter is a frame nobody declared.
//
// Everything here is data-in / verdict-out so the Vitest layer can pin it
// (`scripts/verify/frameSubject.test.mjs`); all browser work — the projection
// probe, the settle poll, the PNG write — lives in `frameSubject.mjs`.
