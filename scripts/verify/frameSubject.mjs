// THE FRAME SHUTTER (point 375): a verification frame is written only after its
// subject has been proven to be IN the rendered picture.
//
// Why the check sits here and not in an assertion afterwards: a suite's asserts
// never look at the frame, and the frames are not comparable between runs
// (point 361), so nothing downstream can notice a picture that missed its
// subject. The shutter is the last moment at which the live camera can still be
// asked — and asked the way CLAUDE.md §7.2 demands: by PROJECTING the subject
// through the camera (`__camera.onScreen`/`ndc` in the bird's-eye view, the
// place camera's own matrices inside a settlement), never against an assumed
// radius.
//
// It also gives the picture a bounded chance to arrive before judging: the wait
// is on the CONDITION (subject projected inside the frame, camera settled), not
// on the wall clock — the same rule `fixedWaits.mjs` enforces. A frame that
// never gets its subject in view is refused, named and NOT written.
//
// And it waits for the picture to be DRAWN before it opens (point 489): a
// subject projects into an empty grey frame exactly as well as into a finished
// one, so proving the aim is not enough. The scene counts as drawn when the
// renderer's own per-frame counters stand still (`sceneReady-core.mjs`); a frame
// that never gets there is refused just as loudly as a mis-aimed one. A HUD
// `element` frame skips the wait and a frame taken deliberately in motion
// (`settle: false`) waits only for a picture to be there — see `sceneReadyMode`.
//
// Usage in a suite:
//   import { frameShutter } from './frameSubject.mjs'
//   const shot = frameShutter(page, OUT)
//   await shot('12-worldmodel-lake-victoria', { world: { lat: -0.8, lon: 33 }, label: 'Lake Victoria' })
//   await shot('98-place-plan', { element: '.map-place-plan', label: 'the town plan' })
//   await shot('115-savanna-dry', { general: 'the whole savanna dressing is the subject' })
//
// A check that only MEASURES pixels (no file, no subject) takes the same route
// for its budget:
//   const buf = await capturePixels(page, 'TRAA mean luma')

// How long the shutter gives the picture to arrive before it judges. Generous

// the subject to be in the picture (a judgment), this one waits for the browser
// to hand the pixels over (I/O). Passing nothing let either inherit Playwright's
// silent 30 s default, and on a host that renders through SwiftShader with no
// GPU a capture under suite load exceeds that — `enrichments` died on the
// map-overlay write 4700 lines before its own subject, on main as much as on any

// failed check; a hung one still fails, four times later.
