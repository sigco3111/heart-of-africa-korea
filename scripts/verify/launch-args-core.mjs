// Pure launch policy for the verify browsers (point 475). scripts/verify/_browser.mjs
// is the single launcher for every browser suite; this module holds the decisions it
// makes, side-effect-free, so the Vitest layer can sweep them without opening a
// browser (scripts/verify/launch-args-core.test.mjs).
//
// Why it exists (measured 03.08.2026, when the project moved to a Linux container):
// the WebGL 2 lane launched with `--use-angle=d3d11`, a Direct3D backend that exists
// only on Windows, and the WebGPU lane launched `channel:'chrome'` — a system Chrome
// that is simply absent on the new host. Neither failure was a code bug; both were a
// hard-coded HOST assumption. The lane args are therefore chosen BY PLATFORM here,
// and the WebGPU lane states out loud when the host cannot run it at all instead of
// quietly producing a WebGL 2 run under a WebGPU label.

/** The ANGLE backend each platform can actually provide.
 *
 *  win32 keeps `d3d11` — the historical value, unchanged byte for byte; the Windows
 *  host is the one this project has always verified on and nothing about it moved.
 *
 *  Linux headless gets `gl` (point 493, 04.08.2026). The earlier `swiftshader` was
 *  chosen on 03.08.2026 from a premise that has since been measured false — "the
 *  container has no GPU, no DRI driver and no system libEGL/libGL". It has all three:
 *  /dev/dxg is passed through, /usr/lib/wsl/lib carries libd3d12/libd3d12core/libdxcore,
 *  and Mesa's d3d12 Gallium driver turns that into hardware GL. With `gl` the lane comes
 *  up as "ANGLE (Microsoft Corporation, D3D12 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti), OpenGL 4.6)"
 *  against SwiftShader's "Vulkan 1.3.0 (SwiftShader Device (Subzero))" — measured on the
 *  identical scene at 170 vs 22.7 renderer calls per second, a 7.5× picture rate. What
 *  the host needs for it is installed by scripts/verify-host-setup.sh (libgl1, libegl1,
 *  mesa DRI) and by the devcontainer's X11 socket.
 *
 *  It DEGRADES rather than breaks: with the X socket gone the same flags still come up,
 *  on SwiftShader (measured — the 03.08 note's "context-less page" does not happen here),
 *  so a host without the graphics stack loses speed and keeps its picture. Which one a
 *  run actually got is not left to inference: backend-lane-check.mjs prints the renderer
 *  string and names a software rasteriser as one.
 *
 *  darwin gets `metal`, the only backend ANGLE has there.

 *  `--force-webgpu-compat` is not optional decoration: Dawn's GLES backend serves a
 *  COMPATIBILITY adapter, and the flag is what makes Chrome hand it over instead of
 *  refusing the request. The lane is therefore a THIRD one, not a replacement — the
 *  adapter carries no `core-features-and-limits`, three.js sets `compatibilityMode` and
