// Is the machine QUIET enough for a timing verdict? — as pure functions (point 296).
//
// The other half of the triage. Point 294 reads a red AFTER the fact
// (baseline-classify-core.mjs: the same check twice is a candidate real failure,
// disjoint checks are the LOAD SIGNATURE). This module acts BEFORE the run, on
// the two things that made 27.07.2026 expensive:
//
//   1. A CONCURRENT LOAD makes a timing verdict worthless. `enrichments` was run
//      while a full unit run and two agents shared the machine: it reported two
//      failures, the retry reported a DIFFERENT one, and the harness concluded
//      "a real failure, not a flake". Every named check was unrelated to the
//      change under test, and the same suite was green on a quiet machine in
//      exactly those checks. Three invalid runs, one wrong conclusion.
//   2. THIS PROJECT'S OWN TOOLING LEAVES LEFTOVERS. A unit run on the same
//      machine produced four "Test timed out in 5000ms" failures in tests that
//      pass in 582 ms alone — the cause was a dev server from an earlier verify
//      run that nobody had shut down. Nothing in the harness looked for it.
//
// So: probe before the run, and either DEFER it or FLAG its result "under load —
// not authoritative" instead of emitting an ambiguous red. The vocabulary is
// point 294's on purpose ("load signature", "judge a red only on a QUIET
// machine") — the two halves describe the same phenomenon from opposite ends.
//
// Everything here is data-in / verdict-out so the Vitest layer can pin it
// (scripts/verify/machine-load.test.mjs). All process work — sampling the CPU,
// listing processes — lives in the wrapper scripts/verify/machine-load.mjs.
//
// FAIL-OPEN throughout: a probe that cannot answer must never stop a run. An
// unknown machine proceeds, loudly labelled unknown; it never blocks and never
// claims quiet.
