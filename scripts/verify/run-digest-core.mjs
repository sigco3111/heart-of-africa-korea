// Pure decision core of the LOGGED verify invocation (point 373 e).
//
// WHY: the session boundary fires between POINTS. Inside one heavy point the
// context still grows unchecked, and the largest single contributor is a verify
// run's own transcript: `run-all.mjs` prints ONE line per suite while it is
// green, but on a red one it echoes the WHOLE captured output — the entire
// vitest dump, the entire tsc/vite build error, the entire lint report. Those
// are the thousands of lines a session pays for, and it pays for them again on
// every poll of a background run.
//
// THE COUNTER-MEASURE IS NOT A COMPACTION: the run's output goes to a FILE, and
// the caller reads a BOUNDED selection of it — the runner's own structured
// lines (every PASS/FAIL/SKIP verdict, every stage heading, every failure echo,
// the retry/flake notices, the final verdict) plus, when the run failed, the
// last few dozen raw lines. What is dropped is the unstructured bulk, which is
// on disk and one `--show` away.
//
// THE FAILING CASE STAYS DIAGNOSABLE — that is the constraint the selection is
// built around, not an afterthought: the failing SUITE names survive as the
// runner's own `FAIL  <suite>` lines, the failing CHECK/TEST names survive as
// the indented `FAIL …` / `ERR: …` echoes beneath them (vitest's own
// ` FAIL  file > case` lines have that shape too), and the digest names them
// once more in a FAILING block so no reader has to scan for them.
//
// Everything here is lines-in / lines-out so the Vitest layer can pin it
// (run-digest-core.test.mjs); all process work — the spawn, the log file, the
// live echo — lives in the wrapper (run-logged.mjs).
