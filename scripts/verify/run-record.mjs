// THE RUN AS ONE CHECKABLE OBJECT (point 592) — the IO half.
//
// A verify run used to exist only as a growing log file and a live process, so
// the only way to learn anything about it was to read the log again. That is
// what a poll IS. The record below is the alternative: one small JSON file
// beside the log that says what the run covers, what it is expected to cost,
// whether it is still going, how often anybody looked, and — once it is over —
// its whole completion receipt.
//
// It is written by scripts/verify/run-logged.mjs (the wrapper owns the run) and
// read by scripts/verify/run-wait.mjs (the caller awaits it) and by
// scripts/wait-marker.mjs (duty (8) of scripts/lock-heartbeat-hook.mjs, which
// proves to the batch guard that a session is waiting rather than idling).
// Every read is failure-tolerant: an absent or unreadable record means "nothing
// known", never a false verdict.
