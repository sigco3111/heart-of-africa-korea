// AWAITING A RUN INSTEAD OF POLLING IT (point 592) — the pure decision half.
//
// WHY: measured over six days (09.08.2026), waiting cost more than any other
// single habit in this project. 2857 responses were poll answers (10.9 % of the
// weighted spend) and another 1189 were bare idle holders (3.6 %); the longest
// unbroken poll chain was 437 responses for a result that is one word. One
// 42-minute LARGE run polled every 30 s costs ~1.9 M weighted for the loop
// alone. Nothing about that loop is work: it re-reads a log that has not
// changed to learn a fact the process will announce by itself.
//
// THE RULE THIS MODULE ENCODES:
//   1. A long run is AWAITED, not polled — either through the harness'
//      completion notification (a background run announces its own exit) or
//      through ONE blocking call with a timeout.
//   2. Where a poll is genuinely unavoidable, the FIRST wait is 0.9 × the
//      suite's MEASURED median runtime, not 30 s. The medians are below and
//      come from docs/picture-check-cost.md §1 — the same table, pinned by
//      run-wait-core.test.mjs so the two cannot drift apart.
//   3. After MAX_POLLS the run is either awaited blocking or treated as HUNG.
//      No third option: 13 chains of ten or more polls carried 4.9 % of the
//      whole window's spend.
//   4. The count is PRINTED, not remembered. `run-wait.mjs --status` is the one
//      counted poll and the verify wrapper prints the total in its receipt, so
//      the rule is visible in the transcript rather than trusted.
//
// Everything here is data-in / data-out so the Vitest layer can pin it; all
// process work — the record file, the frame scan, the blocking wait — lives in
// run-wait.mjs and run-logged.mjs.
