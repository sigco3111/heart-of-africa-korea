// Pure decision core for the SCENE-READINESS WAIT (point 489).
//
// A frame must wait for the PICTURE, not for the clock. The shutter (point 375)
// proves the frame's SUBJECT is in the picture — but a subject projects into an
// empty grey frame exactly as well as into a finished one, so the shutter alone
// accepted frames the world had not been drawn into yet. Measured on the Linux
// container host: after entering the travel scene the renderer climbed from 99
// draw calls / 5.5k triangles at 5 s to 222 / 745k at 30 s. Two suites wrote
// blank frames through that gap and exited 0 — `world` a 47 kB empty village,
// `collision` an empty `52-collision-port-wall.png` — because both waited on
// something that an EMPTY scene satisfies FASTEST of all (a healthy frame rate).
//
// The signal that means "the picture is finished" is the renderer's own
// per-frame counters standing still: `info.render.drawCalls` and
// `info.render.triangles`. Not the cumulative `info.render.calls` — that one
// counts render passes since start-up and climbs forever, on every host, built
// or not.
//
// The judgement is on the SPREAD over a trailing window, not on growth alone: a
// count that FALLS is a region unloading after a jump, which is no more a
// finished picture than one that climbs. The window is wide because the
// streaming curve is STEPPED (point 499 traced a 4 s plateau mid-build), and the
// tolerance is RELATIVE because a finished scene never stands perfectly still —
// wildlife and dressing entering and leaving the frustum moved the counts by
// 1-7 % of their value in every measured settled state, while a half-built one
// moved by 20-98 %.
//
// Everything here is data-in / verdict-out so the Vitest layer can pin it
// (`scripts/verify/sceneReady.test.mjs`); the browser work — installing the
// in-page sampler, polling it, refusing the frame — lives in
// `scripts/verify/frameSubject.mjs`.

/**
 * Calibrated on the container host this point was measured on (05.08.2026);
 * every value is overridable per capture.
 * - `quietMs`   how long the counters must hold still. 5 s: the streaming curve
 *               plateaus for up to ~4 s mid-build (point 499).
 * - `tolerance` relative spread that still counts as "standing still".
 * - `minTriangles` a floor no drawn scene falls below; the measured blank frame
 *               stood at 5.5k, every real one at 99k and up.
 * - `minSamples` fewer readings than this cannot describe a window.
 * - `pollMs`    how often the in-page buffer is read out.
 * - `timeoutMs` generous on purpose: a wait that ends too early writes a false
 *               picture, one that ends late only costs seconds.
