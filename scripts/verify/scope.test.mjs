// THE STATIC NET under the sectioned verify suites (point 566).
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. A suite is one long module whose blocks are
// `if (section('x')) { … }` — and that `{ … }` is a BLOCK SCOPE. A helper
// declared inside one section is invisible to the next, but nothing says so
// until the browser run reaches the call: on 08.08.2026 `pinFamily`, declared in
// `calf-predation-drama` and called from `coastal-walk-off`, aborted the whole
// `enrichments` pass with `pinFamily is not defined` after 176 of its 251 checks
// — 27 minutes to find, both on the first run and on the automatic retry.
// `no-undef` over the same file finds it in a tenth of a second. The point
// exists because repairing a CHECK costs a suite pass; discovering a scope error
// by browser run is that cost paid for nothing.
//
// HOW IT IS WIRED. `.oxlintrc.json` carries an override for `scripts/**/*.mjs`
// that turns `no-undef` on with the browser AND node global sets — both are
// legitimate in one file, because these are Node scripts carrying
// `page.evaluate` callbacks that run in the browser. So the gate is `npm run
// lint` itself: no hook, no extra command, and every existing caller of the lint
// gate (the fast gate, CI, the pre-push hook) inherits it.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE ADDS. Lint being green proves nothing about whether the rule is
// still ARMED. These cases run the REAL config — copied byte for byte — over a
// fixture that reproduces the pinFamily shape, and assert it is refused; a
// future edit that drops the rule, the env or the file glob turns them red.
//
// TWO THINGS THIS FILE GOT WRONG, AND WHY THEY ARE WORTH THE COMMENT (points
// 569/573/606). It used to resolve the linter as
// `resolve(process.cwd(), 'node_modules/.bin/oxlint')`. In a git WORKTREE — where
// CLAUDE.md §6 builds every point — `node_modules/` is git-ignored and therefore
// absent, so the spawn ENOENT'd and BOTH halves of this suite lied:
//   1. the five cases that expect the linter to ACCEPT clean code went red in
//      every worktree run, for a reason that had nothing to do with the change
//      under test — which is how a pool learns to discount a red run;
//   2. the cases that expect it to REJECT bad code kept PASSING, because a spawn
//      that never started exits non-zero exactly like a linter that ran and
//      refused. The rule this suite exists to keep armed could have rotted away
//      unnoticed, in exactly the environment most of our work happens in.
// The resolution now goes through `scripts/local-bin.mjs`, and every negative
// assertion goes through `expectRejected`, which fails as "THE LINTER DID NOT
// RUN" rather than counting a missing binary as a rejection.
