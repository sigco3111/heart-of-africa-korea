// Running ONE SECTION of a browser suite (point 566).
//
// WHY. Repairing a single check cost a whole suite pass. Measured 08.08.2026 on
// point 342: the feature took 22 minutes, the remaining four and a half hours
// were verification — and two of the three repair commits repaired the CHECK,
// not the game (one had to STAGE an animal instead of hoping one streamed into
// view, one read the label list a frame before the drawn labels). Each such
// repair replayed `enrichments` whole: one browser session, 251 checks, over 17
// minutes on the WebGL 2 lane, then the same round again on the second backend.
//
// A name filter on `check()` would buy nothing: the suites are linear scripts —
// boot, jump, wait for herds, assert, jump on — and the expensive part is the
// navigation, the waits and the screenshots, not the assertion. Skipping an
// assertion still replays every jump before it. So the unit that can be skipped
// is a SECTION: a named block that owns the setup it needs (its jumps and waits)
// plus its checks. The boundaries already existed as `// --- … ---` comments;
// `section('<slug>')` turns each into a declaration.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. A `--section` run is PARTIAL and can never be recorded as
// suite coverage: the recorder stamps `partial` on the run record and
// render-verify-core's runVerdict refuses it. Acceptance and closing runs stay
// whole-suite. This is a repair loop, not a cheaper gate.
//
// Everything here is string-in / decision-out so the Vitest layer can pin it
// (scripts/verify/sections.test.mjs); the only I/O is `sectionGate()` reading
// the running suite's own source at the bottom.
