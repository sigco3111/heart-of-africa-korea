// Headless verification for the startup picture (point 337): the loading
// picture must never stand still longer than the calibratable balance budget
// `balance.startup.pictureFreezeBudgetMs`.
//
// WHY IT NEEDS ITS OWN SUITE. The defect it guards is invisible to every other
// gate. The scene's first frames need ~62 shader pipelines, and until point 337
// three.js linked them on the critical path: on WebGL 2 that blocked the main
// thread for 21 s inside two animation frames; on WebGPU the thread stayed
// perfectly free (worst stall 1.0 s) while no frame was PAINTED for 12.4 s.
// Neither a frame-rate check nor a plain liveness check sees both halves — so
// this suite measures BOTH and gates their maximum:
//
//   * a 20 ms setInterval TICK TRAIN, whose stalls are attributed with
//     ./liveness.mjs (point 304) into the part a blocked main thread caused and
//     the part the page spent inside its own animation-frame callbacks, and
//   * the gap between PAINTED frames.
//
// The attribution is REPORTED but never subtracted: point 304 excused a long
// animation frame because the thread stayed responsive, which is right for a
// TTS liveness question and wrong here — a 20 s frame is 20 s of frozen
// picture. Charging the frame-covered part to the budget is exactly what stops
// a busy renderer from hiding the standstill.
//
// Self-test knob: STARTUP_STALL_SELFTEST=1 restores the old blocking pipeline
// path via the dev hook `__asyncPipelinesOff`, which must turn the budget gate
// RED. That is how the gate is proven to still bite.
//
// Dev server only (dev hooks).
