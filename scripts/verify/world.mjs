  // the height the site says the ground is, and the terrain under the block
  // against the water.
  // AND THE COMPARISON IS AGAINST A SECOND SOURCE, not against itself (four-eyes
  // review by GPT-5.6 Sol, 11.08.2026). This check used to read `r.y` against
  // `r.groundY` — BOTH fields of the same site object — so it proved only that the

  // that also said a metre would have passed. The height the block is drawn at is
  // now held against the terrain the WORLD reports under it, sampled independently,
  // which is the field the bird's-eye mesh is built from; the site's own value is
  // reported beside it so a divergence names which of the two moved.
  // The quantity is the LOWEST ground under the whole footprint — the centre
  // sample is the wrong one (Sol's re-review, 11.08.2026): a base above the
  // footprint minimum but below the centre would have passed, and that IS the
  // float this point was filed for. So the footprint is re-sampled here on a
