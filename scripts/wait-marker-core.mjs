// THE WAIT MARKER A HOOK SETS (point 592) — the pure decision half.
//
// WHY: measured over six days (09.08.2026), 1189 responses — 3.6 % of the whole
// window's weighted spend — were bare idle holders: a model turn that does
// nothing except tell the no-idle-stop guard that the session is still there.
// The command exists only because `batch-progress-guard` refuses a silent stop,
// and it is the cheapest turn that satisfies it. A marker a HOOK writes does the
// same job for nothing, because a hook costs no model turn at all.
//
// WHAT IT MUST NOT DO, and the whole reason this file is pure and separate: the
// idle guard may not go BLIND. It exists because the batch stood still for five
// and a half hours on the night of 28.07.2026, and a marker that says "waiting"
// whenever anyone asks would hand that back. So the marker written here is the
// SAME `batch-in-flight` declaration a session writes by hand — same file, same
// shape, same evidence, re-probed by the guard at every single turn end — and it
// is written ONLY where the evidence genuinely exists:
//
//   - this session OWNS the batch (a non-owner declares nothing, ever),
//   - the batch is not paused,
//   - a verify RUN RECORD says a run is going, and its wrapper process is alive,
//   - that run's LOG has been written to within LOG_FRESH_MS,
//   - and the session has not already declared something by hand — a hook never
//     overwrites a person's declaration, only its own.
//
// And the mirror duty, which is what keeps the guard sharp: when the run the
// hook's own marker names has FINISHED, the hook CLEARS it. The wait is over,
// the result is now the session's next action, and the guard should block a stop
// again — exactly as it does when a hand-declared wait ends.
//
// The IO (reading the record, writing the declaration, extending the lease)
// lives in scripts/wait-marker.mjs; the hook that calls it is duty (8) of
// scripts/lock-heartbeat-hook.mjs.

/**
 * How recently a run's log must have been written to for the run to count as

 * HOW OLD THE MARKER MAY GET BEFORE IT IS RE-STAMPED.
 *
 * A declaration ages out at `IN_FLIGHT_MAX_AGE_MS` (45 min) wherever its
 * evidence is not one of the OUTPUT kinds, and a log is not one of them — so a
 * marker written once at the start of an 81-minute both-backends LARGE would be
 * `expired` by minute 46, half way through the very wait it exists for
 * (four-eyes finding 1). It is therefore re-written whenever it passes this age,
 * which costs nothing: the run and its log are re-proved at every write, so a
 * refresh is only ever granted to a wait that is still real.
 *
 * Comfortably under half the expiry, and `wait-marker-core.test.mjs` pins that
 * relation against the constant itself rather than trusting this sentence.

 *   'declare' — write/refresh the hook's marker for a provably running verify run
 *   'clear'   — the hook's OWN marker names a run that is over; withdraw it
 *   'none'    — do nothing, and `reason` says why
 *
 * Every uncertain case answers 'none'. A hook that guesses "probably still
 * running" is the blind guard this must not become.
