// On Windows a child console process gets a NEW console window unless
// CREATE_NO_WINDOW is set, which in Node is `windowsHide: true`. Every member of the
// Stop chain shells out to git several times, and the Stop chain runs at EVERY turn
// end — so a single turn ended in dozens of window flashes.
//
// The fix itself is mechanical and behaviour-neutral (it suppresses a window, not
// output). What is NOT mechanical is keeping it: a newly added `execFileSync` would
// bring the flashes straight back. So this module is the gate, in the shape the
// quality-preset completeness gate uses — a pure audit over the script tree, run in
// the Vitest layer (scripts/window-hide-core.test.mjs), failing on any child-process
// call that does not set the flag.
//
// It is a TEXT audit on purpose: a runtime check cannot see a call that was not made,
// and the offence is exactly a call site written without one option.
