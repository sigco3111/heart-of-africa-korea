// THE BOOT PATH ON THE WINDOWS HOST, and the mutual watch between the two
// scheduled tasks that carry it (point 447, user 30.07.2026).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The measured state of `HoA-Batch-Autostart` on the Windows
// host was ONE time trigger every 15 minutes with `StartWhenAvailable`, principal
// `Interactive` — so it runs only while the user is logged on, and only within a
// quarter of an hour of becoming able to. `AutoAdminLogon` is set there, so a
// reboot logs itself back in, but that path is UNPROVEN: the machine had been up
// since 24.07.2026 and an update restart can still stop at the lock screen. The
// batch would then stand still for the length of an absence with nothing saying
// so. Two gaps follow: the resume is slow (up to 15 min after a logon), and the
// one task that resurrects everything is itself a single point of failure —
// disabled, deleted or silently failing, nothing notices.
//
// The answer is a SECOND scheduled task that watches the first, and a first that
// watches the second, so neither is alone; plus an at-logon trigger, so the
// resume is instant. Registering and modifying scheduled tasks needs admin
// rights, which no agent here has — the arming is therefore ONE idempotent
// script the user runs once from an elevated shell
// (`scripts/windows/setup-boot-path.ps1`), and this module holds everything
// about it that must be provable WITHOUT that machine: the names, the cadence,
// the probe command, how a task report is read, and what a peer's state means.
//
// PURE. Every decision here is a function of its arguments — no file, no
// process, no clock of its own. The IO half lives in
// `scripts/windows-task-watch.mjs`, which is what both tasks actually run.
