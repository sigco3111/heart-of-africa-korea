// What the chief says when the artefact from the boulder is laid in his hands
// (docs/communication-poc-spec.md, work-order point 487).
//
// The hand-over is what solves the puzzle, and the chief acknowledges it IN HIS
// OWN TONGUE: three concepts, spoken like any other phrase in the village, with
// no translation anywhere. A player who learned the words reads them; a player
// who did not sees three runs of syllables and his own `???`. That asymmetry is
// the payoff of the whole slice, so nothing here may localize.
//
// The concepts are deliberately ones the player has necessarily met: BIG_ROCK
// and DIG stand in the chief's own drum message, HERE is one of the children's
// six. Nothing new is introduced at the moment of the solution.
//
// Pure data and pure logic — the sequences are never re-authored here, they come
// from the lexicon like every other utterance.
