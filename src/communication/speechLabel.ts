// The hypothesis over a speaker's head (design.md §13.4,
// docs/communication-poc-spec.md): when a figure speaks an utterance the player
// has already heard, the reading HE wrote for it stands briefly above that
// figure — `???` where he wrote none, one reading per atom for a phrase.
//
// The label holds only WHO speaks and WHICH atoms; the reading itself is read
// out of the heard-store at render time (labelReadings). That is the whole
// point of this module: the journal's note and the overhead label are ONE
// source seen twice, so editing the note in the journal changes what stands
// over the speaker's head at once, with nothing to keep in sync.
//
// Pure logic — no scene, no store, no clock of its own. The caller passes the
// time; an update that changes nothing returns the SAME state object, so a
// consumer can compare by reference and skip a render.
