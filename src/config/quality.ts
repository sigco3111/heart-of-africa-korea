// Three graphics quality levels — low / medium / high (design.md §21, F9 /
// point 276 part B). This module is the SINGLE registry the effective* render
// selectors in state/ui.ts read: each level maps to a value for EVERY
// quality-relevant setting, so a new optical feature declares its low/medium/
// high behaviour HERE (design.md §21 convention) and the completeness gate
// (quality.test.ts) fails if any preset omits a key.
//
// The lever PRIORITY follows the real-hardware benchmark (point 277,
// docs/perf-277-user-hardware.md): the biggest wins are fill-rate (device
// pixel ratio, then the post pipeline), while geometry (terrain refinement,
// flora radius) barely moves a fast GPU and matters only for very weak ones —
// so low leads with dpr + post off and adds the geometry cuts on top.
