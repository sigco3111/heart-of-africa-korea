// Journal read-aloud (design.md §15/§16): speaks journal entries with the
// Kokoro TTS model (kokoro-js), fetched from the Hugging Face CDN on first use
// and cached by the browser. The model runs in a Web Worker (ttsWorker.ts) so
// synthesis never blocks the game loop — the main thread only posts text and
// plays back the returned PCM through the AudioContext. The device is decided
// here on the main thread: the onnxruntime WebGPU compute path (separate from
// the three.js renderer's WebGPU) synthesizes faster than realtime for a fast,
// gapless read-aloud but is only reliable on Chromium, so it is gated to
// Chromium; every other browser (and the headless verification) uses the
// universally-working WASM path. The model is pre-warmed at game start
// (warmupSpeech) so the WebGPU cold load's one-time GPU stall happens up front
// (user decision, point 117, reversing point 100's WASM-only switch). Kokoro
// currently has no German voice, so read-aloud is offered for English only —
// German texts carry the same voice markup so a German-capable engine can be
// added later.
// OPEN: German read-aloud once a German-capable TTS voice is available.
