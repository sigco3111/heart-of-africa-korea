// Post-processing pipeline (design.md §2 "Licht- und Post-Processing-
// Pipeline"): scene pass with MRT normals → GTAO (screen-space ambient
// occlusion) → optional TRAA (temporal anti-aliasing) → bloom → color
// grading (warm highlights, gentle saturation) → subtle vignette. Tone
// mapping (ACES) and output color space are applied by THREE.RenderPipeline
// itself. Also installs the procedural IBL environment on the scene.
//
// TRAA is the default since its manual WebGPU check passed (CLAUDE.md §7.1
// pt. 32); the debug toggle (design.md §21.3) can switch back to the render
// pass' MSAA samples. TRAA requires MSAA off and a velocity MRT target, so
// the scene pass is built per mode.
//
// Screen-space reflections were integrated (design.md §2.7) but removed again
// after the manual WebGPU check (CLAUDE.md pt. 32): with the bird's-eye camera
// never reaching grazing angles and the first-person scenes having no water or
// gloss, no in-game situation makes SSR read, so it was dead weight.
//
// OPEN: true water refraction (design.md §2) is not in the POC pipeline.
