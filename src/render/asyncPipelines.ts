// Non-blocking shader-pipeline creation (point 337).
//
// THE DEFECT. three.js's renderer creates a render pipeline lazily, the first
// frame a given material/geometry/light combination is drawn. On the normal
// render path it passes `promises = null` into `backend.createRenderPipeline`,
// and both backends read that as "the caller wants the pipeline NOW":
//
//   * WebGL 2 links the program and then calls `_completeCompile`, whose
//     `gl.getProgramParameter(program, LINK_STATUS)` is a synchronous
//     command-buffer round trip — it waits out the whole ANGLE + driver
//     compile (CommandBufferHelper::Finish / WaitForGetOffset in a CDP trace).
//   * WebGPU calls `device.createRenderPipeline()`, which returns at once but
//     makes the first draw that uses it block the GPU queue on the compile.
//
// The scene's startup needs ~62 pipelines at once, so the picture stands still
// while they resolve. Measured on the headless verify lanes (a quiet machine,
// 40 s observation window from the first byte):
//
//   WebGL 2   62 pipelines, 36.3 s of blocking link waits inside just TWO
//             animation frames (16.7 s and 20.4 s) — max main-thread stall
//             21.0 s, max gap between painted frames 20.4 s.
//   WebGPU    65 pipelines, 9 ms of createRenderPipeline calls — but no frame
//             was PAINTED for 12.4 s while the driver compiled behind them.
//             The main thread stayed free (max stall 1.0 s), which is exactly
//             why a liveness metric alone never saw this: the picture froze,
//             the thread did not.
//
// THE FIX. Both backends already implement the asynchronous half — three.js
// only ever reaches it from `Renderer.compileAsync()`, which the render loop
// does not use. Handing `createRenderPipeline` a promise array on the ORDINARY
// path switches it over:
//
//   * WebGL 2 polls `KHR_parallel_shader_compile`'s COMPLETION_STATUS_KHR per
//     animation frame instead of waiting on LINK_STATUS.
//   * WebGPU uses `device.createRenderPipelineAsync()`.
//
// In both cases `Pipelines.isReady()` stays false until the pipeline really
// exists, and `Renderer._renderObjectDirect` already SKIPS the draw of a not
// yet ready object. So the first frames draw the reduced set that is ready and
// the rest links behind them, at no cost to the settled picture: every object
// appears as soon as its pipeline is done, and nothing is drawn differently.
//
// This is deliberately left on for the whole session, not just for startup —
// the second of the two blocking frames above was NOT the first frame but a
// later streaming step, and mid-game hitches have the same cause and the same
// cure. Where `KHR_parallel_shader_compile` is missing, three.js falls back to
// the synchronous path on its own, so this degrades rather than breaks.
//
// THE SECOND HALF, WebGL 2 ONLY. Linking asynchronously is not the end of the
// WebGL story: ANGLE defers the actual D3D shader compile to the program's
// FIRST USE, which is `_completeCompile`'s `useProgram`. With the links now all
// resolving in one burst, that burst simply moved — the WebGL 2 lane still went
// 8.5 s without painting a frame. So the completions are RELEASED at most
// `RELEASE_PER_FRAME` per animation frame, which spreads the first-use compiles
// across frames instead of stacking them into one. Measured (same lane):
//
//   release-all  max painted-frame gap 8.5 s
//   2 per frame  max painted-frame gap 2.5 s
//   1 per frame  max painted-frame gap 1.8 s — and that one is the renderer's
//                own init, not a compile; the compile gaps are ~1.3 s apart
//                with the picture updating in between.
//
// One per frame wins because a single first-use compile already costs most of a
// frame on this lane; releasing two just doubles the stall. The WebGPU backend
// has no such step (`createRenderPipelineAsync` resolves a ready pipeline) and
// no `_completeCompile`, so the feature detection below simply finds nothing to
// throttle there.

 * scene is drawn again next frame, so an object whose pipeline is not ready yet
 * — `Renderer._renderObjectDirect` silently SKIPS it — simply appears a frame
 * later. The panorama capture (src/scenes/travel/panoramaCapture.ts) renders the
 * travel scene into an offscreen target ONCE and keeps the pixels forever. Its
 * render target is its own render context, so every object in it needs a NEW
 * pipeline, none of which is ready in the frame the shot is taken: measured
 * 0 of 92 objects ready, 0 draw calls, a fully transparent band — the whole
 * defect of point 545.
 *
 * So the shot compiles synchronously and is complete when it returns. The cost
 * is paid ONCE per session, because the capture keeps its targets: measured on
 * the headless WebGL 2 lane (a machine painting 3-16 fps), 3.4 s for the first
 * capture's ~35 pipelines and ~0.2-0.4 s for every later one, which is the
 * render itself. On WebGPU `createRenderPipeline` returns at once and the
 * compile happens off the main thread, so no comparable stall exists there.
 *
 * Use it around a render that has no next frame — never around the render loop,
 * which is exactly what point 337 moved off the critical path.
