// The settlement edge painted on the ground (design.md §2.6, work-order
// 352/488): where the inhabited ground ends, the swept, trodden earth of the
// settlement gives way to open land across a soft band — so the player can see
// how far he may walk instead of the boundary being invisible until the view
// suddenly changes.
//
// Quiet and of the world: a tonal and textural change in the ground the already
// drawn material carries (the swept inside reads darker, calmer and flatter
// than the mottled open ground outside) — no drawn ring, no glow, nothing a
// traveller of 1890 would not have seen underfoot. It is a term in a material
// that is already drawn, not a pass, so it carries NO quality key: like the sun
// model, it has no measurable cost to switch off.
//
// It must not lie. The band's radius is never written here — it comes from the
// boundary the leave check reads (`src/scenes/place/boundary.ts`), sampled per
// angle into the lookup below, so the two cannot drift. The outline wanders by
// the domain-warp technique the biome borders use (design.md §3.3): the
// coordinate that decides the classification is perturbed by a low-frequency
// noise field before it is measured. The perturbation is bounded by its
// amplitude, so the visible band can never depart from the true boundary by
// more than `EDGE_BAND_MAX_WANDER_M` — it may look natural, it may not mislead.
