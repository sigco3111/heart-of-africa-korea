 * exactly zero at rest), and — point 300 — the foot it stands on must stay
 * PLANTED on the ground while the body travels over it. A phase that merely
 * rides distance is not enough: if the cadence does not match the leg's own

 *
 * The model is the peg-leg walk of a rigid limb pivoting at the hip:
