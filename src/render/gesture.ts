// figure gains arms, and this module is the state machine that moves them.
//
// Everything here is PURE: no THREE object, no clock, no React. The scene owns
// one `GestureState` per figure and advances it with the frame delta; the pose
// it reads back is a set of Euler angles for the two shoulder pivots. That split
// is what lets the whole behaviour be pinned in the fast Vitest layer, and it is
// what lets the speaking layer drive a gesture without knowing any geometry:
// `startGesture` takes a kind and an aim, nothing else.
//
// A gesture NEVER explains itself (point 479.3). This module therefore carries
// no labels, no text and no concept vocabulary — only bodies. What a beckon
// means is decided by what happens next in the world, not here.
