// Blood on the ground (design.md §19.5, point 267): a kill or a trample soaks
// the GROUND SURFACE itself instead of laying a decal over it.
//
// The old depiction was a flat disc mesh floating a few centimetres above the
// terrain along its ground normal. On a slope that reads wrong however it is
// tilted: the disc is a PLANE and the terrain under it is not, so rising ground
// pokes through the middle and the pool shows a see-through hole (user report,
// screenshot 23.07.2026). Raising the disc only makes it hover elsewhere, and
// conforming a mesh to the relief costs geometry per stain.
//
// So the stain became a property of the ground, in the mould of the rain-wet
// ground tint (point 225, seasonTint.ts): the terrain material mixes its albedo
// toward blood inside a world-space patch. Being a shading term of the
// ground surface it follows the relief EXACTLY — there is no second surface that
// could part from it, at any slope, at any zoom, on either backend.
//
// The patches ride a small uniform array the travel scene refills each frame
// with the nearest stains (a uniform, not a fresh material, so it never trips
// point 96's program relink).
//
// Its FOOTPRINT is not a circle (point 323). Blood runs into whatever the earth
// gives it, so the radial falloff is domain-warped per stain — the technique the
// §3.3 biome borders use, applied to the coordinate that decides the falloff
// rather than to the biome: the outline radius at a bearing is the base radius
// times a seeded harmonic contour, so every patch has its own ragged outline and
// no two are alike. The warp is a function of the BEARING alone, which is what
// keeps the point-267 promise intact: along every ray out of the centre the mask
// still falls monotonically, so a ragged outline can never open a hole inside
// the pool. Like the settlement edge band it is a term in a material that is
// already drawn — no pass, no texture, nothing measurable to switch off — so it
// carries no quality key.
