// DEV render-resource leak invariant (point 295) — the in-game-assert principle
// (src/systems/devAssert.ts) applied to GPU resources.
//
// WHY. The point-276 TRAA leak grew the WebGPU render-target set by 3 per toggle
// cycle and was caught only because ONE check in scripts/verify/settings.mjs
// happened to look at renderer.info at the right moment. Every other suite and
// every manual session ran straight past it. This watch turns the same reading
// into a standing invariant: whenever the renderer RETURNS to a state it has
// held before, its resident render-target count must not have grown — else
// console.error + a probe-log entry, in every dev session and every headless
// suite (whose console-error gates fail on it).
//
// THE RULE IS "same state, same cost", not "the counts never move". A place
// scene legitimately holds more than the bird's-eye view, and the high detail
// level more than the low one, so every reading is filed under a SIGNATURE of
// the levers that legitimately change the resident set, and compared only
// against an earlier reading of that same signature.
//
// STRICT ON RENDER TARGETS, COARSE ON TEXTURES. Render targets are allocated by
// the post pipeline (src/render/Effects.tsx), the shadow maps (each scene's own,
// freed when it is left — the bird's-eye sun is a singleton and needs
// src/render/shadowRelease.ts to do it, point 546) and the panorama
// capture's two targets (src/scenes/travel/panoramaCapture.ts, allocated on the
// first capture and kept for the session, so a settlement visit adds none) —
// a bounded set that content never inflates, so a rise of more than
// LEAK_BOUNDS.renderTargets is a real leak.
// Plain TEXTURES stream in with terrain, flora and settlement materials for as
// long as the player explores, so a strict bound there would be a false-positive
// machine; the texture half is a coarse RUNAWAY net (one transition may not add
// more than LEAK_BOUNDS.textures) whose baseline ratchets up with legitimate
// streaming.
//
// MEASURED AT A SETTLED STATE. A pipeline rebuild frees the old chain at commit
// but allocates the new one's targets only on the next RENDERED frame; read in
// that window the count sits in a DIP with the whole post chain missing — the
// trap that produced point 334's false "+14 leaked". So the watch samples on
// requestAnimationFrame and waits for the render-target count to repeat before
// it judges. A reading that never settles (a headless page that stops painting)
// is recorded and DROPPED, never asserted: fail-soft on an environment stall,
// fail-loud only on a product bug.
//
// DEV only — the whole module is behind import.meta.env.DEV and is imported
// dynamically from src/App.tsx, so it is absent from the shipped bundle.
