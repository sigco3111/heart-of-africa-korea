// The seasonal greenness FIELD (design.md §19.13, point 151): a small
// continent-covering texture the travel scene's ground and vegetation sample
// PER POSITION through a baked 'seasonUV' attribute — replacing the single
// player-position uniform whose per-frame drift made every visible crown
// slide ("fly") while walking a wetness gradient, and whose zone flips
// snapped the whole scene at once (user bug, 16.07.2026).
//
// Spatially the field is SMOOTH: each texel stores a blend of the season
// slots (hyper-arid + the climate zones), precomputed ONCE by blurring the
// one-hot slot map with a ~2 degree kernel — so a zone border is a gradient,
// never an edge. Temporally it is driven per frame from the calendar: the 15
// slot greens move with the day (lerped, so a debug month jump fades), and
// the texel values are their weighted blend. Nothing reads the player.
//
// The texel value is the TINT value the old uniform carried (0 = full straw,
// 0.5 = neutral, 1 = full lush), so the shader curves are unchanged.
