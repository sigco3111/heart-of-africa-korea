// The hold-Ctrl label layer (design.md §17.8), in both perspectives.
//
// It mounts only while the key is down: an idle frame runs one boolean
// subscription and nothing else — no traversal, no projection, no DOM. While it
// is up it refreshes a few times a second rather than every frame; the labels
// ride their subjects closely enough for a reading aid, and a per-frame React
// pass over a herd would cost more than the picture gains.
//
// It reuses the map/region label machinery (drei's <Html> and the `map-label`
// class) rather than inventing a second one, so the labels layer with the rest
// of the in-scene text under §17.4. What it does NOT take from them is their
// distance scaling: a place name may swell as the camera nears it, but a
// reading aid that did so filled half the bird's-eye frame with one word (the
// first probe frame). These stay one small size, whatever the distance.
