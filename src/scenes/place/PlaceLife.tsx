/**
 * Two inhabitants standing together in conversation (point 479): they turn
 * toward each other and shift their weight, and they say nothing the player
 * cannot read.
 *
 * THEY NO LONGER GESTURE ON THEIR OWN (point 580). The pair used to cycle the
 * four gestures as ambient dressing, with no utterance behind any of them — the
 * mute pantomime the user reported from the picture ("they gesture, but I see
 * no texts over their heads"), and at ANY distance, since nothing it did could
 * ever be heard. Those four gestures are the very ones the teaching situations
 * use for COME, GO_THERE, THERE and NO, so an ambient pair performing them
 * showed the player concepts with no word attached to them. Gesturing now
 * belongs to the figures that SPEAK: the children's situations and the adults'
 * errands, which drive the same `gesture` refs through the hearing gate
 * (`src/communication/spokenGesture.ts`).
 *
 * The dev hook below still drives the pair's arms directly — it is the rig the
 * headless verification poses the four gestures on (point 479), and it never
 * runs outside a dev build.
 *
 * OPEN: design.md §19.10 still lists this vignette as "pairs stand together in
 * conversation, GESTURING", which point 580's rule contradicts for a pair that
 * says nothing. design.md is not changed unilaterally, so the wording is left to
 * the user's decision: either it drops the gesturing here, or the pair is given
 * real utterances and gestures again behind the hearing gate.
