//
// Three consumers must agree on it and can never be allowed to drift: the leave
// check in PlaceScene (walking past the boundary swaps the scene, design.md
// §2.3), the edge band painted on the ground, which tells the player where that
// boundary lies, and the inhabitants, who keep to the same shape the player
// does. A visible edge in the wrong place is worse than none, because the player
// will trust it — so the band does not carry a radius of its own. It reads THIS
// module, and only this module.
//
// The boundary is NO LONGER A PLAIN CIRCLE (work-order 482): a village standing
// on a river grows a lobe out to the water, so the bank is walkable ground of
// the settlement instead of something past its edge. The lobe is still ONE
// radius per bearing — both shapes it is built from contain the centre, so their
// union is star-shaped about it — which is why the band's angular lookup
// (`buildBoundaryLut`) needed no change at all to follow it.
