// What the children SAY at their game of tag, and what happens next
// (design.md §13.4, docs/communication-poc-spec.md, work-order point 481).
//
// The children teach the six general concepts — COME, GO_THERE, FOLLOW, HERE,
// THERE, NO. Nothing here translates anything: a situation is one atomic
// utterance, the gesture the speaker makes while it says it, and the ACTION
// that visibly follows. The meaning lives in that third part alone, which is
// why every entry of the catalogue carries one.
//
// THREE RULES THE CATALOGUE IS BUILT ON, each of them a thing the mechanic
// fails without:
//  1. ONE ATOM PER SITUATION. A situation never speaks a phrase — a player who
//     hears two atoms in one situation cannot tell which of them the action
//     belongs to.
//  2. EVERY CONCEPT IN MORE THAN ONE SITUATION. Heard in a single situation an
//     utterance reads as a rule of the game ("this is what you shout when you
//     are IT"), not as a word.
//  3. THE TWO LOOK-ALIKES ARE STAGED APART. COME and FOLLOW both end with
//     someone moving toward the speaker: COME is spoken at least once by a
//     child STANDING STILL, while FOLLOW's caller is always running away.
//     GO_THERE and THERE both point at a distant spot: GO_THERE is always
//     followed by the addressee walking there, THERE at least once by nobody
//     moving at all.
//
// The scheduler is a FAIR QUEUE, not a die roll: of the situations the live
// game can cast right now, the one staged LEAST often goes next. A random pick
// can starve a situation for a whole visit, and a situation nobody ever sees is
// a concept that cannot be learned. Two kinds are offered out of that turn — a
// REFUSAL, which only ever answers the call just spoken, and a MOMENT, whose
// state (a catch has just happened) is gone again within seconds. The dice are
// kept for the timing spread and for whether a call is refused.
//
// Everything here is PURE — no THREE object, no clock, no store. The scene
// (PlaceLife) hands in a view of the running game, plays what comes back and
// steers the children through `childSteer`, which is what lets the whole
// teaching be pinned in the fast test layer.
