// Pure layout of the walkable Giza monument site (design.md §4.4, docs/
// giza-1890.md). The three great pyramids stand in their real south-west
// diagonal row — Khufu largest in the NE, Khafre centre (raised on higher
// bedrock so it reads as tall as Khufu and alone keeps its pale Tura-limestone
// casing cap near the apex), Menkaure smallest in the SW with a red Aswan
// granite skirt at its base — and the Great Sphinx crouches east of Khafre,
// facing east, buried to the shoulders in sand as a ~1890 expedition found it
// (nose long gone). Each monument is a giant collidable mass the traveller
// walks around; the site carries a handful of Thomas-Cook-era ambient people
// (robed guides/dragomen, Bedouin cameleers, donkey-boys, tourists, camels and
// donkeys) but no trade, no elder and no hints — a walkable monument space.
//
// The site is distinct from the game's Meroë (Nubian) pyramids by design: Giza
// is a FEW HUGE, shallow ~52° masses (height ≈ 0.64·base·2), Meroë a dense
// cluster of small, steep ~70° cones — the slope ratio here is far flatter than
// MEROE_PYRAMIDS' (~2.6·base) so the two can never be mistaken.

 * Walkable radius of the Giza site (m); leaving it exits to the bird's-eye
 * view. MEASURED, not guessed (point 390): the plateau's surroundings are an
 * open plain that the picture runs unbroken to the horizon, so the walkable
 * ground has to reach as far as the scene affords — the former 60 put the edge
 * ~27 m past the outermost pyramid, in the middle of flat empty sand.
 *
 * The measurement (recorded in `gizaSite.test.ts`, swept over 720 azimuths at
 * eye height against the real geodata):
 *  - The drawn backdrop ground reads as flat open sand out to the backdrop's
 *    own outer edge (340) over the whole western and southern half; the median
 *    azimuth breaks only at 191.
 *  - The one seed-independent break is the Nile's water band at 76, in the
 *    eastern arc (~340°→95°). The geometry backdrop is the FALLBACK horizon;
 *    on a normal entry the captured §2.5 band carries the Nile.
 *  - The backdrop's relief is no usable target: it is a compressed miniature
 *    anchored to the disc edge, so it begins immediately past the plate at any
 *    radius.
 * The binding limit is therefore the §2.5 panorama band, and the radius is
 * derived from it (`openPlainWalkRadius`) rather than written as a round guess.
