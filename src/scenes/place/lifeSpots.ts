 *     voices inside one earshot and must tell them apart by other means;
 *  3. separated alone, then whatever the place allows.
 * Within a rank the score below decides, and SIZE is what it spends: the ground
 * SHRINKS (down to MIN_PLAY_RADIUS) to sit among the huts rather than reaching
 * out past the last of them. `clearance`, `openness` and `fabric` report what
 * was actually achieved, so a layout that cannot manage one of them fails a
