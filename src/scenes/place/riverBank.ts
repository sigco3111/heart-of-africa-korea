// The walkable river bank of a settlement that stands on a river (work-order
// 482): where the water lies, which way it runs, and how far along it the
// player may walk.
//
// EVERYTHING HERE IS DERIVED FROM THE WORLD MODEL, never hand-placed. The
// settlement scene is a compressed miniature of its own surroundings — the
// §2.5 panorama samples the real terrain at `BACKDROP_SCALE` degrees per place
// unit — so the river the player walks up to inside the village is the SAME
// river the bird's-eye view draws, seen at that scale: its bearing from the
// centre is the bearing of the real course, its distance is the real gap
// between the village and the water's edge, and the current runs the way the
// real course runs (source → mouth). Nothing is painted into the backdrop and
// nothing is invented; a change to the course or to the calibratable river
// width moves the bank in the settlement with it.
//
// A bank exists only where the geography actually carries one: a VILLAGE whose
// water's edge lies clear of its built ground but within a short walk of it.
// Ports sit AT their river by design (the §4.2 exemption) and their much wider
// walkable disc would swallow the waterline, so they never grow one.
