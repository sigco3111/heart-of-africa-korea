// GETTING THERE, not merely facing there (work-order 482/483).
//
// An inhabitant used to walk at its target in a straight line and let the
// collision resolve sort out the rest. That works for the short hops inside the
// built fabric it was written for, and it fails the moment a target lies on the
// FAR SIDE of that fabric: the river bank is a walk of some forty metres out
// past the huts and the compound fences, and a straight-line seeker presses
// head-on into the first fence panel on the way and stands there for the rest of
// the errand. It closes most of the gap and never arrives — which is exactly
// what the bank errands did.
//
// So the walk gets a ROUTE. The settlement's free ground is sampled once per
// visit into a coarse occupancy grid, a breadth-first search over it returns the
// waypoints from where a villager stands to where it was sent, and a
// line-of-sight pass pulls that staircase straight again so the figure walks the
// natural line and only bends where something is genuinely in the way.
//
// The grid is built from THE SAME two sources the movement itself obeys — the
// walkable boundary (`insidePlace`, bank lobe included) and the full collider
// set — so a route can never lead where the mover will then be stopped. It is
// pure data: no three.js, no scene, and every rule below is pinned in Vitest.
