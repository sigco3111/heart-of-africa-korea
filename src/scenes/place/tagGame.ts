// The village children's game of tag (design.md §19.10, work-order 480/351).
//
// They run wild through the settlement, around the huts and past the fire. One
// of them is IT and chases the others; whoever is caught becomes the new IT.
// Any number plays — one chaser and every other child in the group.
//
// A PATH IS NOT A GAME, and that is the design point this module must not undo:
// any fixed route — a ring around the well, an orbit at a set radius, a tour of
// waypoints — is periodic, and the eye recognises it within two passes. A chase
// is not periodic because its target REACTS. Nothing here holds a route.
//
// STAMINA IS WHAT MAKES IT LEGIBLE. The reserve, the pace curve and the two
// decisions live in `systems/pursuit.ts` (a chase with stamina is reusable — a
// goat bolting from someone, a dog in a port); this module adds only the ROUND:
// who is IT, who may be caught, and what happens when one of them is.
//
// THE STEERING IS THE WILDLIFE'S, NOT THE WALKER'S. The village walkers resolve
// an obstacle by sliding along it and stopping, which is exactly what reads as
// bumping into things. `deflectedStep` probes around the heading and CONTINUES
// the run past the obstacle — a chase wants that one, and reusing it is why this
// behaviour is small rather than large. The move is SUBSTEPPED at under a body
// radius, because `deflectedStep` probes points rather than sweeping: one long
// frame at a debug-raised sprint speed would otherwise land cleanly on the far
// side of a fence panel, overlapping nothing.

/**
 * The armed invariants (point 207(i)). Tests only look where they look; this

 * for the rare states that hide between several continuous quantities and a role
 * that moves between figures. A violation reports itself with the state that
 * produced it, so a bug report names the situation instead of a feeling.
 *
 * This half judges the ROUND as the step RECEIVED it — exactly one chaser while
 * playing, a tenure inside the cap, reserves in bounds, nobody pinned past its
 * window — because a step that repairs a broken state and only then asserts
 * would report nothing at all.
