// Ambient wildlife for the travel view (design.md §19): non-threatening
// herds as scenery (elephants, giraffes, zebra, wildebeest, antelope, warthog,
// flamingos at the lakes), a purely decorative predator hunt (lion, cheetah,
// leopard or hyena taking prey from its food web), and vultures circling the
// player when the expedition is in poor condition. The animals interact with
// one another: wandering elephants trample smaller animals underfoot (dead
// over a red stain), prey flee an active predator, and vultures gather above a
// kill. Herds raise young: calves gambol, get hunted (with the parent's rescue
// sacrifice) and fall into water (with the parent's rescue and the waterfalls'
// toll); kills leave remnants that the circling flock descends on and
// finishes (the ground scavenger serves only carcasses without a flock,
// e.g. trampled ones), animals keep body spacing and never stray into the
// open ocean. Only walking into the lion attacks the player (§14);
// otherwise no gameplay effect.
