// Zoom-aware flora streaming (design.md §19.9, points 164 + 171). Two pop
// sources are closed here, both about WHERE the drawn edge sits relative to
// what the player can actually see:
//   • point 164: the dressing used to rebuild a FIXED ±6-chunk square, so its
//     corner (≈120-227 units) swept in and out of view and jumped back and
//     forth across a chunk boundary. Replaced by a CIRCLE gated behind a move
//     hysteresis, so the pop is off-screen and a back-and-forth never re-pops.
//   • point 171: that circle was sized to an ASSUMED view of 100×zoom, but the
//     real visible ground reaches the SCENE FOG far plane (region preset
//     165-330), far beyond 100×zoom — so at a wide zoom plants still streamed
//     in WITHIN the view (faintly fogged, but visible). The circle now follows
//     the fog far (the definitive visible limit — nothing renders past it), so
//     its edge is always fully fogged out at ANY zoom, without trusting a
//     frustum estimate. And the per-chunk fill runs NEAREST-FIRST, so a full
//     instance buffer drops the FARTHEST plants (the drawn edge stays a fogged
//     circle) instead of fraying a ragged, chunk-order boundary into view.
// Kept separate from the three.js render loop so the rules are unit-testable.
