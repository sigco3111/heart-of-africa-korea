// Travel-scene panorama capture (design.md §2.5, point 81): the moment the
// traveller enters a settlement, the still-mounted travel scene renders a
// 360° horizon band from the settlement's position into a texture. The
// first-person view then shows the REAL surroundings — the mountains, water
// courses and dressing that lie there in the bird's-eye view, direction-true
// — instead of a genericized relief. The capture survives the scene switch
// (the render target lives on the renderer); entering without a live travel
// scene (loading a snapshot, a ferry passage) leaves no capture and the
// place scene falls back to the geometry backdrop.
