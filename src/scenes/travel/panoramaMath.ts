 * It was read as MIRRORED between 14.07.2026 and point 545 — content at the
 * negated bearing, slice k as [N, W, S, E][k], and the horizon cylinder
 * sampling the mirrored column to match. That convention was calibrated against
 * a band that was drawn but WRONGLY CUT: the per-sector viewport was read off
 * the render target rather than the renderer, so every sector covered the full
 * width and only the LAST camera — k=3, looking west — survived, stretched 4:1.
 * The July landmark measurement (Giza at u 0.405) is what that band predicts:
 * Giza stands 10.7° south of due west, and (1 − tan 10.7°)/2 = 0.4055, closer
 * than the mirrored convention's own 0.399. So the basis was invalid, though
 * not for the reason first recorded here — the band only went EMPTY on
 * 25.07.2026, when pipeline creation became asynchronous and the one-shot shot
 * began skipping every object (point 545). With the capture drawing again and
 * cut per sector, a magenta pillar injected
 * DUE WEST of the capture point lands at u 0.875 — dead centre of slice 3,
 * whose camera looks west — measured on the WebGL 2 path, and the rendered
 * horizon shows it in the west.
