// helpers decide the candidate, whether a Space press may enter it, and which
// collider circles the move resolves against, so the logic is unit-testable
// apart from the Three.js travel scene. The two radii are coupled: the collider
// stays INSIDE the enter radius, so approaching a place always arms the prompt
