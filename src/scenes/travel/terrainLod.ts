//
// The DEM texel is 0.025 deg = 0.25 world units; the base LOD samples a chunk
// at 0.43-1.2 wu per vertex, which re-quantizes the C1-smooth bicubic
// elevation field into polyline folds — the "angular mountains" report. The
// shading is already smooth (central-difference vertex normals), so the
// remaining facets are the SILHOUETTE class: only finer tessellation rounds
// them. Mirroring the accepted coastal doubling, a near chunk with real
// mountain relief doubles its segments (capped), so mountains sample at
// ~1 texel while the flat basins keep the base cost.
