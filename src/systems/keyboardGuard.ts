// Keeping the game's keys out of the browser's chords (work-order 601).
//
// Holding the label modifier names what acts on screen (design.md §17.8) and W
// walks forward, so the feature's ORDINARY use is Ctrl+W — which closes the tab
// without asking. Point 342's rule that "the browser's own Ctrl combinations
// stay the browser's" is superseded by exactly that case.
//
// Two mechanisms, because neither alone is enough:
//   - `preventDefault` takes away every Ctrl (or Alt) chord the platform lets a
//     page take away — Ctrl+S, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+A, Ctrl+F … — but only for
//     the codes the game itself binds, and only while the game surface, not a
//     form control, has the keyboard.
//   - Ctrl+W, Ctrl+T and Ctrl+N are RESERVED: no keydown handler reaches them.
//     The one mechanism that does is the Keyboard Lock API
//     (`navigator.keyboard.lock`), which captures them only while the document
//     is FULLSCREEN, and only on Chromium. The game therefore holds the lock
//     exactly while it is fullscreen AND holds the pointer, and its absence is
//     never an error — a browser without it simply does not get this
//     protection, which is why the label modifier is rebindable as well
//     (design.md §17.5/§17.8).
