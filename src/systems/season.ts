//
//  * Do NOT derive rain from the convergence line's latitude. The rainband lags
//    400+ km SOUTH of it, so a naive sun-following model rains on the Sahara
//    every August. The profiles here encode the rain, not the convergence.
//  * East Africa is not derivable from that sweep at all (Nicholson 2018 holds
//    the classic explanation "not tenable"), so its bimodal calendar is stated
//    outright rather than computed.
//  * The Sahel around 1890 was WET — the game's window sits inside the
//    1870-1895 humid period. Its dry-season floor is therefore lifted, not the
//    modern drought image.
