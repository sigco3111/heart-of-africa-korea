// Seasonal presence in the settlements (design.md §19.13, TASKS point 142):
// "the young men are gone". The research's best-attested life mechanic — the
// settlement stands, but part of its people are away with the season — and its
// equally important negative: the sedentary peoples are NEVER away.
//
// Evidence per entry (docs/peoples-1890.md §4):
//  * Maasai — PERIOD (Thomson, §7.1): the camp moves "up from the plains to the
//    highlands in the DRY season and vice versa in the wet season" — the
//    counter-intuitive direction, period-sourced. So in the local dry months
//    part of the village is at the dry-season camps.
//  * Tuareg — MODERN/RETRO-APPLIED, and an extrapolation the research marks:
//    Aïr men spend "five to seven months each year" on the Bilma/Kano caravans;
//    the game's village is Ahaggar. INFERRED window: the great autumn caravan
//    departs after the rains — men away roughly October-February.
//  * Hausa/Bambara/Mandinka — PERIOD (Barth, §4.9): the RAINS move the farmers
//    out to the field huts; the village reads emptier in its wet months. (The
//    §4.9 finding that inverts the indoor/outdoor intuition.)
//  * Bemba, Lunda — §4.0.5: sedentary, "no month empties them". The negative
//    case, asserted so the mechanic never becomes universal.
//  * Everyone else: full presence — no evidence, no invention.
//
// The SHAPE, from the research: "a camp of women, children and elders" — so the
// factor thins the adult WALKERS about the settlement, never the children or
// the elder.
