// Sea-mouth shaping of the river courses (design.md §11.3, point 316).
//
// A river that reaches the sea does NOT arrive at full pace: the channel fans
// out over its delta, the bed gradient dies against sea level and the sea backs
// the water up, so the last reach is slack water. The game modelled the mouth
// as a funnel instead — full-strength current right up to the coast contour —
// and that turned the mouth junction into a TRAP. At the Nile's Rosetta mouth
// (~31.4N/30.4E) the channel's last stretch is a water finger poking into
// Mediterranean sea cells that are impassable in every direction: the drift
// there (0.32 deg/s without a canoe) outran the swim speed (0.28 deg/s), so a
// swimmer was pushed back into the finger's tip as fast as he could swim out of
// it — the reported softlock. Every other sea mouth had the same shape.
//
// The fix is the mouth's own geometry: the current RAMPS DOWN to nothing over
// the last `MOUTH_SLACK_DEG` of the course, so the water edge meets the coast
// with slack water instead of a one-way funnel. Nothing about the rendered
// ribbon, the mouth bridge (§11.3 point 211), the water mask or the ocean's
// impassability changes — only how hard the water pushes in the last reach.
//
// Dependency-light on purpose (data + the vector coast only), because
// world/hydro.ts consumes it while building its segment index and must not
// close a cycle back through terrain/geoIndex.
