// Fast, deterministic unit/component layer (CLAUDE.md §7.2): pure logic, store
// transitions and the HTML HUD components run in jsdom with no browser or dev
// server, so the bulk of the regression finishes in seconds and never flickers
// on RAF/browser timing. The remaining browser-only checks stay in Playwright
// (scripts/verify/*.mjs).
//
// JSX is transformed by esbuild with the automatic React runtime (no
// @vitejs/plugin-react — its vite-8/rolldown build does not load under
// Vitest's bundled vite, so its JSX transform would silently fall back to the
// classic runtime and break component tests).

    // 5000 ms and the slowest honest cases here sit at 1.5-2.3 s of it — a real
    // git probe, a heavy constructor, a child process. This project's DESIGNED
    // steady state is three worktree agents building, and that load alone
    // doubled them past the bar: on 28.07.2026 `npm run test:unit` went red
    // twice within ten minutes on `main`, 2 then 5 failures, every single one
    // `Test timed out in 5000ms` and not one an assertion. The gate that reads
    // it then blocked the push. These are deterministic pure-logic and jsdom
    // tests: a case that passes in 2 s and one that HANGS are orders of
    // magnitude apart, so a generous ceiling costs nothing on a green run and
    // still fails a real hang. A single case that legitimately needs longer
    // gets its own explicit timeout — this floor is not raised a second time.

    // 15 jsdom processes on this machine — and at that width the MAIN thread no
    // longer answers its own workers: every run ended in `[vitest-worker]:
    // Timeout calling "onTaskUpdate"`, an unhandled error that exits 1 while
    // all 4799 tests PASS. The pre-push gate reads that exit code, so a green
    // regression could not be pushed at all. Measured on a quiet machine, twice
    // each: at the default width the run reports ~573 s of environment setup
    // and dies on the RPC; at 4 workers it reports ~178 s and exits 0 — with
    // the SAME ~91 s wall clock, because the extra forks were queueing, not
    // running. The cap therefore costs no time and buys back the gate. Raise it
    // only against a measurement showing the wall clock actually falls.
